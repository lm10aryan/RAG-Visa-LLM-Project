    "content": "H-1B Specialty Occupations\nALERT: On Sept. 19, 2025, the President issued a Proclamation, Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers , an important initial step to reform the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program. Under the Proclamation, new H-1B petitions filed at or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025 must be accompanied by an additional $100,000 payment as a condition of eligibility. Additional information is available in the \"Presidential Proclamation on Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers\" section below.\nALERT: USCIS will process H-1B, H-2A, and H-2B related Form I-129 petitions and CW-1 related Form I-129CW petitions during the government shutdown. We recognize, however, that the shutdown may affect a petitioner’s ability to get required documentation (such as a labor condition application or a temporary labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor), which may delay their ability to file Form I-129 or Form I-129CW.\nIf an H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, or CW-1 petitioner meets all other applicable requirements and submits evidence establishing that the primary reason they did not timely file an extension of stay or change of status request was due to the government shutdown, we will consider the government shutdown an extraordinary circumstance beyond the petitioner’s control when we determine whether to excuse their failure to timely file the extension of stay or change of status request. We will monitor the situation closely and publish additional guidance if needed. Find additional information in Vol. 2, Part A, Chapter 4 of the USCIS Policy Manual.\nAlert: We have received enough petitions to reach the congressionally mandated 65,000 H-1B visa regular cap and the 20,000 H-1B visa U.S. advanced degree exemption, known as the master’s cap, for fiscal year 2026.\nThis nonimmigrant classification applies to people who wish to perform services in a specialty occupation, services of exceptional merit and ability relating to a Department of Defense (DOD) cooperative research and development project, or services as a fashion model of distinguished merit or ability.\nOn September 19, 2025, the President issued a Proclamation, Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers , an important initial step to reform the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program. Under the Proclamation, certain H-1B petitions filed at or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025 must be accompanied by an additional $100,000 payment as a condition of eligibility.\nWho is subject to the $100,000 payment:\nThe Proclamation applies to new H-1B petitions filed at or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025, on behalf of beneficiaries who are outside the United States and do not have a valid H-1B visa. The Proclamation also applies if a petition filed at or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025, requests consular notification, port of entry notification, or pre-flight inspection for an alien in the United States.\nIn addition, if a petition filed at or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025, requests a change of status or amendment or extension of stay and USCIS determines that the alien is ineligible for a change of status or an amendment or extension of stay (e.g., is not in a valid nonimmigrant visa status or if the alien departs the United States prior to adjudication of a change of status request), the Proclamation will apply and the payment must be paid according to the instructions provided by USCIS.\nThe Proclamation does not apply to any previously issued and currently valid H-1B visas, or any petitions submitted prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025. In addition, the Proclamation does not prevent any holder of a current H-1B visa, or any alien beneficiary following petition approval, from traveling in and out of the United States.\nThe Proclamation also does not apply to a petition filed at or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025, that is requesting an amendment, change of status, or extension of stay for an alien inside the United States where the alien is granted such amendment, change, or extension. Further, an alien beneficiary of such petition will not be considered to be subject to the payment if he or she subsequently departs the United States and applies for a visa based on the approved petition and/or seeks to reenter the United States on a current H-1B visa.\nHow to pay the $100,000 payment:\nPetitioners should submit the required $100,000 payment using pay.gov, following the instructions on pay.gov at the following link: https://www.pay.gov/public/form/start/1772005176 .\nWhen to pay the $100,000 payment:\nPayment must be made prior to filing a petition with USCIS, as petitioners must submit proof that the payment has been scheduled from pay.gov or evidence of an exception from the $100,000 payment from the Secretary of Homeland Security at the time of filing the H-1B petition. Petitions subject to the $100,000 payment that are filed without a copy of the proof of the payment from pay.gov or evidence of an exception from the Secretary of Homeland Security will be denied.\nExceptions granted by the Secretary of Homeland Security:\nExceptions to the $100,000 payment are granted by the Secretary of Homeland Security in the extraordinarily rare circumstance where the Secretary has determined that a particular alien worker’s presence in the United States as an H-1B worker is in the national interest, that no American worker is available to fill the role, that the alien worker does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States, and that requiring the petitioning employer to make the payment on the alien's behalf would significantly undermine the interests of the United States. Petitioning employers who believe their alien worker satisfies this high threshold may seek an exception by sending their request and all supporting evidence to H1BExceptions@hq.dhs.gov .\nThe occupation requires:\nTheoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge; and\nAttainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in a directly related* specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States.\nThe position must also meet one of the following criteria to qualify as a specialty occupation:\nA U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree in a directly related specific specialty, or its equivalent, is normally the minimum entry requirement for the particular occupation;\nA U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree in a directly related specific specialty, or its equivalent, is normally required to perform job duties in parallel positions among similar organizations in the employer’s industry in the United States;\nThe employer, or third party if the beneficiary will be staffed to that third party, normally requires a U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree in a directly related specific specialty, or its equivalent, to perform the job duties of the position; or\nThe specific duties of the offered position are so specialized, complex, or unique that the knowledge required to perform them is normally associated with the attainment of a U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree in a directly related specific specialty, or its equivalent.*\nFor you to qualify to perform services in a specialty occupation you must meet one of the following criteria:\nHold a U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree required by the specialty occupation from an accredited college or university;\nHold a foreign degree that is the equivalent to a U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree required by the specialty occupation from an accredited college or university; or\nHold an unrestricted state license, registration, or certification that authorizes you to fully practice the specialty occupation and be immediately engaged in that specialty in the state of intended employment.\nHave education, specialized training, and/or progressively responsible experience that is equivalent to the completion of a U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree in the specialty occupation, and have recognition of expertise in the specialty through progressively responsible positions directly related to the specialty.**\nYes. The prospective petitioner must include evidence that a Form ETA-9035/9035E, Labor Condition Application (LCA) has been certified by the Department of Labor (DOL), with Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker. See the DOL’s Office of Foreign Labor Certification .\nFor more information see the Information for Employers and Employees page.\nH-1B2\nDOD Researcher and Development Project Worker\nThe job must require a bachelor’s or higher degree, or its equivalent, to perform the duties. The petition must be accompanied by:\nA verification letter from the DOD project manager for the particular project stating that the beneficiary will be working on a cooperative research and development project or a coproduction project under a reciprocal government-to-government agreement administered by DOD. Details about the specific project are not required.\nA general description of the beneficiary's duties on the particular project and the actual dates of the beneficiary's employment on the project.\nA statement indicating the names of aliens currently employed on the project in the United States and their dates of employment and the names of aliens whose employment on the project ended within the past year.\nTo be eligible for this classification you must have a bachelor's or higher degree or its equivalent in the occupational field in which you will be performing services. This requirement can be met based on one of the following criteria:\nHold a U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree required by the duties from an accredited college or university\nHold a foreign degree that is the equivalent to a U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree from an accredited college or university; or\nHold an unrestricted state license, registration, or certification that authorizes you to fully practice the duties of the job and be immediately engaged in that specialty in the state of intended employment\nHave education, specialized training, or progressively responsible experience in the specialty that is equivalent to the completion a U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree, and have recognition of expertise in the specialty through progressively responsible positions directly related to the specialty.**\nH-1B3\nFashion Model\nThe position/services must require a fashion model of prominence.\nTo be eligible for this visa category you must be a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability.\n*For more information, see 8 CFR §214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A). For purposes of the specialty occupation criteria at paragraphs (h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) through (4), “normally” means conforming to a type, standard, or regular pattern, and is characterized by what is considered usual, typical, common, or routine. Normally does not mean always.\nFor purposes of the specialty occupation definition and criteria, “directly related” means that there is a logical connection between the required degree, or its equivalent, and the duties of the position. See 8 CFR § 214.2(h)(4)(ii).\n**For more information see 8 CFR §214.2(h)(4)(iii)(C).\nSome professions require an H-1B beneficiary to hold a state or local license authorizing the beneficiary to fully practice the specialty occupation.\nIf an occupation in the state of intended employment requires such a license, an H-1B beneficiary seeking classification in that occupation generally must have that license before the petition is approved, rather than at the time of filing the petition. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(v)(A)-(B) . When a license is required, but there is no evidence of the beneficiary holding one, USCIS will generally issue a request for evidence of the required license.\nIn 2020, we implemented an electronic registration process for the H-1B cap. We will not consider a cap-subject H-1B petition to be properly filed unless it is based on a valid, selected registration for the same beneficiary and the appropriate fiscal year, unless the registration requirement is suspended. For more information about the H-1B registration process, visit our H-1B Electronic Registration Process webpage.\nStep 1: (only required for specialty occupation and fashion model petitions): Employer/Agent Submits LCA to DOL for Certification. The employer/agent must apply for and receive DOL certification of an LCA. For further information regarding LCA requirements and DOL's process, see the Department of Labor’s Foreign Labor Certification page.\nStep 2: Employer/Agent Submits Completed Form I-129 to USCIS. The employer/agent should file Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, at the correct location or online. Please see our I-129 Direct Filing Chart page. If subject to the Presidential Proclamation discussed above, the Form I-129 must be accompanied by either proof from pay.gov that the $100,000 payment has been scheduled for the specific beneficiary or by evidence of an exception from the $100,000 payment from the Secretary of Homeland Security. The DOL-certified LCA should also be submitted with the Form I-129 (only for specialty occupation and fashion models). See the instructions to the Form I-129 for additional filing requirements.\nStep 3: Prospective Workers Outside the United States Apply for Visa and/or Admission. If the Form I-129 petition is approved, the prospective H-1B worker who is outside the United States may apply with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad for an H-1B visa (if a visa is required). Regardless of whether a visa is required, the prospective H-1B worker must then apply to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for admission to the United States in H-1B classification.\nProspective specialty occupation and distinguished fashion model employers/agents must obtain a certification of an LCA from the DOL. This application includes certain attestations, a violation of which can result in fines, bars on sponsoring nonimmigrant or immigrant petitions, and other sanctions to the employer/agent. The application requires the employer/agent to attest that it will comply with the following labor requirements:\nThe employer/agent will pay the H-1B worker a wage that is no less than the wage paid to similarly qualified workers or, if greater, the prevailing wage for the position in the geographic area in which the H-1B worker will be working.\nThe employer/agent will provide working conditions that will not adversely affect other similarly employed workers.\nAt the time of the labor condition application there is no strike or lockout at the place of employment.\nNotice of the filing of the labor condition application with the DOL has been given to the union bargaining representative or has been posted at the place of employment.\nAs an H-1B specialty occupation worker, you may generally be admitted for a period of up to 3 years. This initial period of admission may generally be extended for an additional period of up to 3 years, for a total period of admission of 6 years. If you possess a controlling interest in the petitioning organization or entity, meaning you own more than 50% of the petitioner or have majority voting rights in the petitioner, the approval of your initial petition and your first extension petition will each be limited to a validity period of up to 18 months.\nHowever, you may be eligible for an H-1B extension beyond the sixth year under 8 CFR 214.2(h)(13)(iii)(E) if you are the beneficiary of an approved immigrant visa petition under the EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3 classifications, and are eligible to be granted that immigrant status but for application of the per country or worldwide limitations on immigrant visas. Petitioners must demonstrate the visa is not available as of the date they file an H-1B petition with USCIS. We may grant extensions on this basis in up to 3-year increments until we make a final decision to revoke the approval of the immigrant visa petition or to approve or deny your application for an immigrant visa or application to adjust status to lawful permanent residence.\nAlternatively, under 8 CFR 214.2(h)(13)(iii)(D) , you may be eligible for an H-1B extension beyond the sixth year if at least 365 days have passed since a labor certification was filed with the Department of Labor on your behalf (if such certification is required) or an immigrant visa petition was filed with USCIS on your behalf.\nYou are ineligible for this extension beyond the sixth year if you fail to file an adjustment of status application or apply for an immigrant visa within 1 year of an immigrant visa being available. If the accrual of such 1-year period is interrupted by the unavailability of an immigrant visa, you will have a new 1-year period after an immigrant visa again becomes immediately available, during which you generally must file an adjustment of status application or apply for an immigrant visa. We may, in our discretion, excuse a failure to file an adjustment of status application or apply for an immigrant visa within 1 year of an immigrant visa being available if your employer establishes that the failure to apply was due to circumstances beyond your control. When considering whether to excuse a failure to timely file within 1 year, we will look at the totality of the circumstances, which may include:\nwhether there was a change of employment;\nwhether the change of employment was voluntary;\nwhen and why the employment with the original employer ended; and\nwhat steps you and your new employer took after the change of employment to file an adjustment of status application or apply for an immigrant visa.\nWe may excuse a failure to timely file in cases of both voluntary and involuntary change of employment when considering the totality of the circumstances. We may grant extensions under this provision in up to 1-year increments until the approved permanent labor certification expires or a final decision has been made to:\ndeny the application for permanent labor certification, or, if approved, to revoke or invalidate the approval;\ndeny the immigrant visa petition, or, if approved, revoke the approval;\ndeny or approve your application for an immigrant visa or application to adjust status to lawful permanent residence; or\nadministratively or otherwise close the application for permanent labor certification, immigrant visa petition, or application to adjust status.\nYour employer will be liable for the reasonable costs of your return transportation if they terminate your employment before the end of your period of authorized stay. Your employer is not responsible for the costs of your return transportation if you voluntarily resign from your position. For more information, please see Options for Nonimmigrant Workers Following Termination of Employment .\nThe H-1B classification has an annual numerical limit (cap) of 65,000 new statuses/visas each fiscal year (with certain deductions and additions based on H-1B1 set asides and usage). An additional 20,000 petitions filed on behalf of beneficiaries who have earned a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. institution of higher education are exempt from the cap. Additionally, H-1B workers who are petitioned for or employed at an institution of higher education or its affiliated or related nonprofit entities, a nonprofit research organization, or a government research organization, are not subject to this numerical cap.\nFor further information about the numerical cap, see our H-1B Cap Season page .\nChanging Employers\nWhen can I begin working for a new H-1B employer if I change employers?\nIf you are changing H-1B employers, you may begin working for the new employer as soon as they properly file a non-frivolous Form I-129 petition on your behalf, or as of the requested start date on that petition, whichever is later.\nTo be eligible for portability, you must not have been employed without authorization from the time of your last admission into the United States, and your new employer must properly file a new, non-frivolous petition before your H-1B period of authorized stay expires.\nWill I still have employment authorization if I change employers?\nIf you are eligible for H-1B portability, your employment is authorized until USCIS has made a decision on the Form I-129.\nIf the new I-129 petition is approved, you may continue working for the new employer for the period of time indicated on the new petition approval.\nIf the new petition is denied, you may continue working for your previous employer if your prior period of authorized employment is still valid, but your authorization to work based on portability ceases upon denial of the petition.\nIf you are laid off, fired, quit, or otherwise cease employment with your previous employer, you may have up to 60 consecutive days or until the end of your authorized validity period, whichever is shorter, to find new employment, change status, or depart the country.\nCan I move from cap-exempt to cap-subject employment?\nIf you are moving from cap-exempt to cap-subject employment, your new employer’s H-1B petition will be subject to the H-1B cap . If subject to the cap, your new employer must first submit an electronic registration when registration period opens. This is typically in March.\nIf more unique beneficiaries are registered than projected as needed to meet the cap for a given fiscal year, unique beneficiaries of properly submitted registrations will be randomly selected. All registrants of selected beneficiaries will be notified of selection and selection notices will be uploaded to their account informing them that they may file a petition for the beneficiary named in the selection notice during the applicable filing period. H-1B cap petitions must have a start date of Oct. 1 (or later) of the applicable fiscal year and may not be filed more than 6 months before the requested start date on the petition.\nIf you are currently employed in a cap-exempt position, you may engage in concurrent employment in a cap-subject position as long as you will continue to be employed in the cap-exempt position. You may begin working concurrently for the cap-subject employer as soon as they properly file a non-frivolous Form I-129 petition on your behalf, or as of the requested start date on that petition, whichever is later. As long as you continue your cap-exempt employment, were previously counted toward the cap, or otherwise remain cap exempt, you will not become subject to the H-1B cap again during the same H-1B validity period.\nChanging Employment Terms with the Same Employer\nWhat if I want to start new employment or change employment terms with my current employer?\nForm I-129 is also used to request new employment or a change of employment with the same employer.\nIf your current H-1B employer properly files a non-frivolous Form I-129 requesting new employment or a change of employment on your behalf, you are authorized to work according to the terms of the new or changed employment once that petition is filed, or as of the requested start date on that petition, whichever is later.\nYour spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age may seek admission in the H-4 nonimmigrant classification. Certain H-4 dependent spouses of H-1B nonimmigrants can file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, as long as the H-1B nonimmigrant has already started the process of seeking employment-based lawful permanent resident status.

    "content": "H-1B Cap Season\nAlert: We have received enough petitions to reach the congressionally mandated 65,000 H-1B visa regular cap and the 20,000 H-1B visa U.S. advanced degree exemption, known as the master’s cap, for fiscal year 2026.\nThe H-1B Program\nThe H-1B program allows companies and other employers in the United States to temporarily employ foreign workers in occupations that require the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and a bachelor’s degree or higher in a directly related specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States. H-1B specialty occupations may include fields such as architecture, engineering, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences, medicine and health, education, business specialties, accounting, law, theology, and the arts. For more information about the H-1B program,, visit our H-1B Specialty Occupations webpage.\nWe use the information provided during the electronic registration process to help us determine if a petition is subject to the congressionally mandated cap of 65,000 H-1B visas (commonly known as the “regular cap”) or the advanced degree exemption. The advanced degree exemption is an exemption from the H-1B cap for beneficiaries who have earned a U.S. master’s degree or higher and is available until the number of beneficiaries who are exempt on this basis exceeds 20,000.\nCongress set the current annual regular cap for the H-1B category at 65,000. Please note that up to 6,800 visas are set aside from the 65,000 each fiscal year for the H-1B1 program under the terms of the legislation implementing the U.S.-Chile and U.S.-Singapore free trade agreements. Unused visas in this group become available for H-1B use for the next fiscal year’s regular H-1B cap.\nNot all H-1B nonimmigrant visas (or status grants) are subject to this annual cap (for example, petitions filed by U.S. institutions of higher education are cap exempt). H-1B workers performing labor or services in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and Guam may also be exempt from the H-1B cap (see the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 (CNRA), Public Law 110-229). H-1B workers in Guam and the CNMI are exempt from the H-1B cap if their employers file the petition before Dec. 31, 2029.\nH-1B cap-subject petitions, including those eligible for the advanced degree exemption, may not be filed unless based on a valid and selected registration for the beneficiary named in the petition (unless the registration requirement is suspended).\nYou may file an H-1B petition no more than 6 months before the employment start date requested for the beneficiary. On April 1, USCIS will begin accepting online filing for H-1B cap petitions and associated Forms I-907 for petitioners whose registrations have been selected.\nPetitioners also have the option of filing a paper Form I-129 H-1B petition and any associated Form I-907 if they prefer. However, users will not be able to link paper-filed Forms I-129 and I-907 to their online accounts. For paper-filed forms, you must file the petition at the correct location. Please see our Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-129 page.\nComplete all required sections of Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker , including the H Classification Supplement and the H-1B Data Collection and Filing Fee Exemption Supplement in accordance with the regulations and form instructions. Please be sure to access the most current versions of forms at uscis.gov/forms .\nYou must indicate a start date of Oct. 1 or later (of the applicable fiscal year, and 6 months or less from the receipt date of the petition) on your petition or your petition will be rejected or denied.\nYou must provide a copy of the H-1B Registration Selection Notice for the registration filed by your organization on behalf of the beneficiary with the petition. Ensure that you have also entered the corresponding “Beneficiary Confirmation Number” on the H Classification Supplement (Page 13, Question 5).\nYou must submit evidence of the beneficiary’s passport or travel document used at the time of registration to identify the beneficiary. If the passport or travel document expires between when a registration is submitted and when the H-1B petition is filed, the petitioner should follow the form instructions regarding which passport information should be entered on Page 3, Part 3 of Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker . In support of the H-1B petition, the petitioner should provide documentation for both passports or travel documents to establish that the passport or travel document was valid at the time of registration and an explanation as to why there was a change in identifying information.\nEnsure that any information provided during the electronic registration process matches the information provided on the petition. If any information does not match, you should provide an explanation with your petition and supporting documentation as to why there was a change or why the information does not match. If information on the registration and petition does not match, USCIS may reject or deny the petition. USCIS encourages the use of a brightly colored coversheet flagging the issue to ensure that this is reviewed upon receipt.\nMake sure each form is properly signed. Ensure all signatures comply with the requirements described in the form instructions and as explained in the USCIS Policy Manual .\nRequired fees may be paid by check, money order, or credit card . If paying the required fees by check or money order, include signed checks or money orders with the correct fee amount. Please submit separate checks for each fee associated with the filing. Place all checks on the top of your petition packet. If you are filing online, you may pay by credit card or bank account via ACH transfer.\nSubmit all required documentation and evidence with the petition at the time of filing to ensure timely processing.\nEnsure that the Labor Condition Application (LCA) properly corresponds to the position in your petition.\nFor paper-filed forms, you must file the petition at the correct location. See the section below on Where to Mail Your H-1B Petition .\nEnsure that the petitioner’s name on the Form I-129 petition is the same as the petitioner’s name on the G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, if filing Form G-28.\nNote: It is your responsibility to ensure that Form I-129 is completed accurately and submitted properly.\nLabor Condition Application (LCA)\nWhen filing your H-1B petition with USCIS, you must include evidence that an LCA (ETA 9035) has been certified by the U.S. Department of Labor. This may include a copy of the signed, certified LCA. (Note: USCIS encourages petitioners to keep Department of Labor LCA processing times in mind when preparing the H-1B petition and to plan accordingly.) If the LCA was previously submitted in a petition that has been approved, you must submit a list including the name and USCIS case receipt number of any foreign worker who has previously used the LCA. You may not use an LCA for more workers than specified in Part B, Question 7 of the LCA.\nPlease see the Department of Labor’s Office of Foreign Labor Certification website for more information on the LCA process.\nEvidence of Beneficiary’s Educational Background\nYou must submit evidence of the beneficiary’s education credentials (with English translations when applicable) at the time you file your petition. If the beneficiary has met all of the requirements for a degree, but the degree has not yet been awarded, you may submit the following alternate evidence:\nA copy of the beneficiary’s final transcript; or\nA letter from the registrar confirming that the beneficiary has met all of the degree requirements. If the educational institution does not have a registrar, then the letter must be signed by the person in charge of educational records where the degree will be awarded.\nIf you indicate that the beneficiary is qualified based on a combination of education and experience, please provide substantiating evidence at the time you file your petition.\nEvidence of Bona Fide Position\nYou must submit evidence that you have a bona fide position in a specialty occupation available for the beneficiary as of the start date of the validity period requested on the petition. You are not required to establish specific day-to-day assignments for the entire time period requested in the petition.\nPetitioners may not file multiple or duplicative H-1B petitions for the same beneficiary. To ensure fair and orderly distribution of available H-1B visas, we will deny or revoke multiple or duplicative petitions filed by an employer (including its related entities that filed without a legitimate business need) for the same H-1B worker and will not refund the filing fees. Multiple or duplicative petitions will be denied or revoked even if they are filed pursuant to a selected registration. For additional information, please see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(G); PM-602-0159, Matter of S- Inc., Adopted Decision 2018-02 (AAO Mar. 23, 2018) .\nWe accept online filing for H-1B cap petitions and associated Forms I-907 for petitioners whose registrations have been selected.\nPetitioners also have the option of filing a paper Form I-129 H-1B petition and any associated Form I-907 if they prefer. However, users will not be able to link paper-filed Forms I-129 and I-907 to their online accounts. For paper-filed forms, you must file your petition at the correct location. We have specific mailing addresses for cases that are subject to the H-1B cap. To determine the correct mailing address see our Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker page .\nPlease read the filing instructions carefully. If you file your petition at the wrong location, we may reject it. Rejected petitions will not retain a filing date. If your petition is rejected because it was filed at the wrong location, you may refile your rejected petition at the correct location (or online) as long as the petition is properly refiled during the designated 90-day filing window on your Registration Selection Notice.\nThere are different fees depending on the type of H-1B petition you are submitting. Please refer to the Fee Schedule and H and L Filing Fees for Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker page for detailed instructions on H-1B fees.\nThe fee for each registration has increased to $215 for the FY2026 H-1B cap.\nThe U.S. Department of Treasury has approved an increase in the daily credit card transaction limit from $24,999.99 to $99,999.99 per day for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card for the FY 2026 H-1B cap season. This increase is in response to stakeholder feedback and the volume of previous H-1B registrations that exceeded the daily credit card limit. Transactions more than $99,999.99 may be made via Automated Clearing House (ACH). Use of ACH may require the payor to alert their bank in advance to remove any potential ACH block on their account. We will provide additional information before the start of the initial H-1B registration period.\nThere is a daily transaction limit for credit cards of $24,999.99 per credit card per day for petitions that are sent by mail.\nChecks\nCheck must be:\nPayable to the Department of Homeland Security;\nInclude the proper amount and signature.\nWe prefer that you submit a separate check for each fee. For example, if you are required to pay the base filing fee, the fraud fee, and the ACWIA fee, you should submit three separate checks. If you only submit one check as combined payment for all applicable fees and certain fees do not apply or are incorrect, we will reject your H-1B petition.\nMoney Orders\nMoney orders must be properly endorsed.\nIncorrect Filing Fee\nWe will reject all petitions submitted with the incorrect filing fee.\nPremium processing is currently available for all H-1B petitions. Additional information is available on our How Do I Request Premium Processing? page.\nAs a reminder, USCIS recently announced a final rule that will increase the filing fee for Form I-907, to adjust for inflation, effective Feb. 26, 2024. If USCIS receives a Form I-907 postmarked on or after Feb. 26, 2024, with the incorrect filing fee, we will reject the Form I-907 and return the filing fee. For filings sent by commercial courier (such as UPS, FedEx, and DHL), the postmark date is the date reflected on the commercial courier label if there is no shipping or print date indicated, USCIS considers the postmark date to be 10 calendar days before the USCIS lockbox or USCIS facility receives the package.\nPreferred order of documents at time of submission:\nForm G-28 (if represented by an attorney or accredited representative)\nCopy of the Registration Selection Notice for the Beneficiary Named in the Petition\nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker\nAddendums/Attachments\nH Classification Supplement to Form I-129 and/or Trade Agreement Supplement to Form I-129 (for H-1B1 Chile-Singapore petitions)\nH-1B and H-1B1 Data Collection and Filing Fee Exemption Supplement\nAll supporting documentation to establish eligibility. Provide a table of contents for supporting documentation and separate the items as listed in the table.\nArrival-Departure Record (Form I-94) if the beneficiary is in the United States\nSEVIS Form I-20 if the beneficiary is a current or former F-1 student or F-2 dependent\nSEVIS Form DS-2019 if the beneficiary is a current or former J-1 or J-2\nForm I-566 if the beneficiary is a current A or G nonimmigrant\nDepartment of Labor certified LCA, Form ETA 9035\nEmployer/attorney/representative letter(s)\nOther supporting documentation\nWe request that petitioners no longer provide duplicate copies of their Form I-129 petition or supporting evidence, as this can result in misidentification of filings. Due to enhanced electronic scanning capabilities and data-sharing with the U.S. Department of State, duplicate copies are no longer needed to avoid delays in consular processing.\nHow to mail multiple petitions together\nIf you will include multiple petitions in the same package, please place the individual petitions into separate envelopes within the package.\nForm G-28 , Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative\nIf you will be represented by an attorney or other accredited representative, submit a properly completed Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative. For further information on Form G-28, please see our Filing Your Form G-28 page.\nForm I-129 , Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker\nComplete all required sections of the form accurately and in accordance with the regulations and form instructions.\nH-1B cap petitions and advanced degree exemption petitions for the FY 2026 cap must include an employment start date of no earlier than Oct. 1, 2025. You must indicate a start date of Oct. 1, 2025, or later (and 6 months or less from the receipt date of the petition) on your petition or your petition will be rejected or denied. Do not file petitions earlier than 6 months before the requested employment start date. We will reject H-1B petitions requesting a start date of “As Soon As Possible” or “ASAP.”\nEnsure that you have entered the “Beneficiary Confirmation Number” on the H Classification Supplement.\nEnsure that the petition is properly signed.\nPetitioners should enter their own address in Part 1, question 3 of the Form I-129. This will ensure that the I-797 receipt and approval notices are sent to the petitioner.\nYou must include the beneficiary’s passport or travel document number, country of issuance, and expiration date on the Form I-129. The passport or travel document information helps USCIS to confirm that the beneficiary named in the registration notice is the same individual as the beneficiary named in the petition and avoid processing delays.\nEnsure that the beneficiary’s name is spelled properly and that their date of birth is displayed in the proper format (mm/dd/yyyy). Also, review the country of birth and citizenship and the I-94 number (if applicable) for accuracy.\nEnsure that any information provided during the electronic registration process matches the information provided on the petition. If information between the registration and petition does not match, the petition may be rejected or denied. If any information does not match, you should provide a written explanation and supporting documentation as to why there was a change or why the information does not match.\nIf the beneficiary is seeking an extension of stay, amendment of stay, or change of status, the petition must include evidence (such as a Form I-94 or Form I-797 approval notice) to establish that the beneficiary will have maintained a valid nonimmigrant status through the employment start date being requested.\nInclude a copy of the beneficiary’s valid passport or travel document.\nH Classification Supplement to Form I-129\nYou can find the H Classification Supplement beginning on page 13 of Form I-129.\nPlease be sure to complete all required sections of the form accurately and in accordance with the regulations and the form instructions.\nIn listing previous periods of stay in H or L nonimmigrant classification, please also include the actual nonimmigrant classification held (such as H-1B or L-1).\nThe petitioner must sign the form, preferably in black ink.\nH-1B and H-1B1 Data Collection and Filing Fee Exemption Supplement\nYou can find the H-1B and H-1B1 Data Collection and Filing Fee Exemption Supplement beginning on page 21 of Form I-129.\nPlease be sure to complete all sections of the form accurately.\nMake sure you are filing a valid edition of Form I-129, as specified in the Edition Date section on the Form I-129 page.\nIf you filed an H-1B cap petition in a timely manner, but received notification from the delivery service that suggests that there may be a delay or damage to the package or that the package was misrouted, you may file a second H-1B petition with a new fee payment during the designated 90-day filing window on your Registration Selection Notice and the following:\nAn explanation as to why a second petition is being filed, with supporting evidence, such as the notice from the delivery service; and\nA request to withdraw the first petition filed for the H-1B cap.\nIf you do not include these items, you will be considered to have submitted duplicate petitions. We may deny or revoke multiple or duplicative petitions filed by the same petitioner, for the same H-1B worker in the same fiscal year, and will not refund the filing fees.\nIf you properly file a second H-1B petition and withdraw the first, we will withdraw the first petition and proceed with adjudication of the second petition.\nWhen we receive a timely and properly filed H-1B cap subject petition, the petitioner (and, if applicable, the petitioner’s legal representative) will be provided a Form I-797, Notice of Action, communicating receipt of the petition. Due to increased filing volumes typically seen during H-1B cap filing periods, there are instances where a petition is timely and properly filed, but issuance of the Form I-797 is delayed. If a petitioner has confirmation from the delivery service that the petition was delivered, but they have not yet received a Form I-797 confirming receipt of the petition, the petitioner should not submit a second petition. If a petitioner has confirmation from the delivery service that the petition was delivered, and they submit a second petition, the petitioner will be considered to have submitted duplicate petitions. This will result in the denial or revocation of both petitions.",

    "content": "H-1B Electronic Registration Process\nAlert: We have received enough petitions to reach the congressionally mandated 65,000 H-1B visa regular cap and the 20,000 H-1B visa U.S. advanced degree exemption, known as the master’s cap, for fiscal year 2026.\nIf you are a prospective petitioner (also known as a registrant) seeking to file H-1B cap-subject petitions, including for beneficiaries eligible for the advanced degree exemption, you must first electronically register and pay the associated H-1B registration fee for each prospective beneficiary. See Fee Schedule, Form G-1055 .\nThe electronic registration process streamlines processing by reducing paperwork and data exchange. It provides overall cost savings to employers seeking to file H-1B cap-subject petitions.\nUnder this process, if you seek to employ H-1B workers subject to the cap, you and your authorized representative, if applicable, must complete an electronic registration that requires basic information about you and each unique beneficiary you are requesting. We require registrants to provide valid passport information or valid travel document information for each beneficiary. The passport or travel document provided must be the one the beneficiary intends to use to enter the United States if they are issued an H-1B visa. Each beneficiary must only be registered under one passport or travel document. For additional information on the passport or valid travel document requirement, please see the Frequently Asked Questions section below.\nThe initial registration period is for a minimum of 14 calendar days each fiscal year. USCIS then runs the H-1B selection process to select unique beneficiaries based on properly submitted electronic registrations. If we select the unique beneficiary, then each registrant that registered for that beneficiary receives a registration selection notice and may file an H-1B cap-subject petition on their behalf. Selections take place after the initial registration period closes, so you do not need to register on the day the initial registration period opens. You can only file an H-1B cap-subject petition if you receive a selection notice for the beneficiary of the petition.\nFY 2026 H-1B Cap Process Update\nWe selected enough unique beneficiaries during the initial registration period projected as needed to reach the fiscal year 2026 H-1B numerical allocations (H-1B cap), including the advanced degree exemption, also known as the master’s cap.\nWe selected 118,660 unique beneficiaries, resulting in 120,141 selected registrations in the initial selection for the FY 2026 H-1B cap.\nWe have now received enough petitions to reach the congressionally mandated 65,000 H-1B visa regular cap and the 20,000 H-1B visa U.S. advanced degree exemption, known as the master’s cap, for fiscal year 2026.\nFY 2026 H-1B Cap Registration Analysis\nDuring the registration period for the FY 2026 H-1B cap, we saw a significant decrease in the total number of registrations submitted and eligible beneficiaries compared to FY 2025, including a decrease in the number of registrations submitted on behalf of beneficiaries with multiple registrations.\nThe number of unique employers this year for FY 2026 (approximately 57,600) was comparable to the number last year for FY 2025 (approximately 52,700).\nThe number of eligible unique beneficiaries this year for FY 2026 (approximately 339,000) was significantly lower than the number last year for FY 2025 (approximately 442,000).\nThe number of eligible registrations was also dramatically lower for FY 2026 (343,981) compared with FY 2025 (470,342) - a 26.9% reduction.\nOverall, we saw an average of 1.01 registrations per beneficiary this year for FY 2026, compared to 1.06 for FY 2025. This means that, on average, each beneficiary only had approximately one registration submitted on their behalf.\nHistorical Data\nThis chart shows registration and selection numbers for fiscal years 2021-26:\n*The count of eligible registrations excludes duplicate registrations, those deleted by the prospective employer before the registration period closed, those denied for having invalid passport or travel document information, and those with failed payments.\nMeasures to Combat Fraud in the Registration Process\nThe data for the FY 2025 and FY 2026 H-1B cap registration period indicates that there were far fewer attempts to gain an unfair advantage than in prior years. This is in large part because we implemented the beneficiary-centric selection process under the final rule Improving the H-1B Registration Selection Process and Program Integrity .\nWe remain committed to deterring and preventing abuse of the H-1B registration process and to ensuring that only those who follow the law are eligible to file an H-1B cap petition.\nWe remind the public that at the time each registration is submitted, each prospective petitioner is required to sign an attestation, under penalty of perjury, that:\nAll the information contained in the registration submission is complete, true, and correct;\nThe registrations reflect a legitimate job offer; and\nThe registrant, or the organization for whom the registration is submitted, has not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.\nIf we find that this attestation was not true and correct, we will find the registration to not be properly submitted. The prospective petitioner would not be eligible to file a petition based on that registration. We may deny a petition, or revoke a petition approval, based on a registration that contained a false attestation and therefore was not properly submitted. Furthermore, we may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action, as appropriate.\nWe remind registrants that each registration must provide the beneficiary’s valid passport or travel document information (including passport or travel document number, country of issuance, and expiration date). If we find that the registration contains invalid passport or travel document information (such as “NA” or “00000”), we will find the registration to not be properly submitted.\nBased on evidence from the FY 2023 and FY 2024 H-1B cap seasons, we have undertaken extensive fraud investigations, denied and revoked petitions accordingly, and continue to make law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution. We are also reviewing the FY 2025 data and will review the FY 2026 data for any attempts to gain an unfair advantage through the beneficiary-centric selection process. If applicable, we will deny or revoke any petitions and make law enforcement referrals for criminal prosecution accordingly.\nWe believe that the decreased filing rate for FY 2024 H-1B cap petitions and the decreased registration numbers for FY 2025 and FY2026 indicate that these investigations, and the beneficiary-centric selection process, have been effective integrity measures.\nThe H-1B program is an essential part of our nation’s immigration system and our economy, and we are committed to implementing the law and helping meet the ever-changing needs of the U.S. labor market.\nYou can report suspected immigration benefit fraud and abuse to USCIS through our online tip form .\nFor more information about the H-1B program, visit our H-1B Specialty Occupations webpage.\nTo submit an H-1B registration, you must first create a USCIS online account .\nUSCIS organizational accounts allow multiple people within an organization and their legal representatives to collaborate on and prepare H-1B registrations, H-1B petitions, and any associated Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service. Registrants need an organizational account to submit registrations for the H-1B cap selection process. For more information on creating and using organizational accounts, please see our Organizational Accounts FAQ .\nThe initial registration period for the FY 2026 H-1B cap opened at noon Eastern on March 7 and ran through noon Eastern on March 24.\nVisit our USCIS YouTube channel for recordings of the FY 2026 H-1B Cap national engagement(s) and USCIS Tech Talks once they are available.\nBased on our experience with the H-1B electronic registration period, the top two user errors are:\nCreating the wrong type of account; and\nEntering the same beneficiary more than once.\nMake Sure You Create the Right Type of Account\nThere are three types of USCIS online accounts:\nApplicant/petitioner/requestor account - Individuals use this type of account to prepare and file applications, petitions, or other benefit requests. You cannot use this account type to prepare or submit H-1B registrations.\nAttorney/representative account - If you are an attorney or accredited representative (legal representative) submitting H-1B registrations on behalf of a prospective petitioner, select this option. You will also be able to submit Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative.\nOrganizational account (formerly registrant account) - This is the account that a prospective petitioner must create to participate in the H-1B registration process, even if the prospective petitioner will work with an attorney or accredited representative to submit the registration.\nAvoid Duplicate Entries\nA prospective petitioner may only have one registration submitted per beneficiary per fiscal year. After the initial registration period has closed, if the prospective petitioner has more than one registration submitted for the same beneficiary, we will invalidate all registrations submitted for that beneficiary by that prospective petitioner, or their authorized attorney or representative, from the selection process. This does not prevent other prospective petitioners or their representatives from submitting registrations for that same beneficiary, but they too need to ensure that each of them, as a prospective petitioner, only has one registration submitted for the beneficiary.\nWe have added duplicate checker functionality to the electronic registration process.\nBefore you submit your registration(s), you can check if the registrant/prospective petitioner named in the draft submission previously submitted a registration for any of the beneficiaries included in that draft submission for the same fiscal year. Using this check does not guarantee that you will not submit a duplicate. This check will compare the beneficiaries listed in the draft with any registrations previously submitted during this registration period. It will not check for duplicates within that draft or between drafts. Even if using this check function, the burden is still on the registrant and their authorized attorney or representative, if applicable, to ensure that no duplicate registrations are submitted. We also provide a tool to download a .csv file and search for duplicate entries. Also, we recommend that attorneys and authorized individuals who work for the same company coordinate to eliminate duplicates before submitting their registrations.\nIf you discover you or your representative submitted more than one registration for the same person and the initial registration period is still open (before noon Eastern on March 24, 2025), you can go into your account and delete the extra submission(s) until there is only one registration for the beneficiary. We do not refund the fee if you delete a duplicate registration.\nIf you discover that you or your representative submitted more than one registration for the same person and the initial registration period has closed (after noon Eastern on March 24, 2025), there is no way to correct this error. We will remove all registrations submitted for the beneficiary by, or on behalf of, that prospective petitioner from the selection process. We do not refund the fee for a removed registration.\nWhen you submit your registration(s), you must attest, under penalty of perjury, that all of the information contained in the submission is complete, true, and correct. The attestation that is required before submission indicates, “I further certify that this registration (or these registrations) reflects a legitimate job offer and that I, or the organization on whose behalf this registration (or these registrations) is being submitted, have not worked with, or agreed to work with, another registrant, petitioner, agent, or other individual or entity to submit a registration to unfairly increase chances of selection for the beneficiary or beneficiaries in this submission.”\nIf we find that this attestation was not true and correct (for example, that a company worked with another entity to submit multiple registrations for the same beneficiary to unfairly increase chances of selection for that beneficiary), we will deny or revoke the petition based on a registration with a false attestation in accordance with the regulatory language at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(ii) and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(11)(iii)(A)(2). Furthermore, we may also refer the individual or entity who submitted a false attestation to appropriate federal law enforcement agencies for investigation and further action as appropriate.\nFor information on fees, see Fee Schedule, Form G-1055 . The fee for each registration has increased to $215 for the FY 2026 H-1B cap.\nEach registration is for a single beneficiary.\nRegistrants or their representative must pay the non-refundable H-1B registration fee for each beneficiary before they are eligible to submit a registration for that beneficiary for the H-1B cap.\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury has approved an increase in the daily credit card transaction limit from $24,999.99 to $99,999.99 per day for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card for the FY 2026 H-1B cap season. This increase is in response to stakeholder feedback and the volume of previous H-1B registrations that exceeded the daily credit card limit.\nThere is a daily transaction limit for credit cards of $24,999.99 per credit card per day for petitions that are sent by mail. Alternatively, you can:\nProcess transactions using a checking account. The checking account information (routing and account number) must be from a financial institution located in the United States.\nH-1B Registration Process Timeline\nMarch 7: H-1B registration period opened at noon Eastern.\nMarch 24: H-1B registration period closed at noon Eastern.\nMarch 31: Date by which USCIS notified selected registrants.\nApril 1: The earliest date that FY 2026 H-1B cap-subject petitions based on the registrations selected during the initial FY 2026 selection period were able to be filed.\nWe intend to notify registrants and their representatives with selected registrations via their USCIS online accounts.\nRegistrants’ online accounts will display a registration status. Descriptions of the possible registration statuses that may be seen in association with submitted H-1B registrations are as follows (that is, for each beneficiary registered):\nSubmitted: The registration has been submitted and is eligible for selection. If the initial selection process has been completed, this registration remains eligible, unless subsequently invalidated, for selection in any subsequent selections for the fiscal year for which it was submitted.\nSelected: Selected to file an H-1B cap petition.\nNot Selected: Not eligible to file an H-1B cap petition based on this registration.\nDenied: The passport or travel document information listed on the registration is invalid, or multiple registrations were submitted by or on behalf of the same registrant for the same beneficiary. If denied as a duplicate registration, all registrations submitted by or on behalf of the same registrant for this beneficiary for the fiscal year are invalid.\nInvalidated - failed payment: A registration was submitted but the payment method was declined, not reconciled, or otherwise invalid.\nDeleted: The submitted registration has been deleted and is no longer eligible for selection.\nProcessing submission: USCIS is processing your submission. It may take up to 72 hours for all of your case information to show on the case details page. While it is processing, you will be unable to access your draft.\nH-1B cap-subject beneficiaries, including those eligible for the advanced degree exemption, must have a valid “Selected” registration notification for that specific fiscal year for a registrant or representative to properly file an H-1B cap-subject petition. The status of registrations that are not selected as part of any initial random selection process, and not denied or invalidated, will remain as “Submitted.” Registrants and representatives who are not selected will not be notified until after USCIS has determined that they have reached the H-1B cap for that fiscal year.\nQ. Are there any changes to the H-1B electronic registration form for FY 2026?\nA. The FY 2026 H-1B electronic registration form is very similar to past years. You still only need to provide basic information about the prospective petitioner and beneficiary.\nH-1B registrants must also provide valid passport information or valid travel document information for each beneficiary. The passport or travel document provided must be the same as the beneficiary used to enter the United States; if or when they are outside the United States, it must be the document they intend to use to enter the United States if they receive an H-1B visa. Also, the passport or travel document’s validity period must be current and unexpired. Each beneficiary must be registered under only one passport or travel document.\nThe passport or travel document must be valid at the time of registration. If the passport or travel document expires between when a registration is submitted and when the H-1B petition is filed, the petitioner should enter data from the new, currently valid passport or travel document on Page 3, Part 3 of Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker . In support of the H-1B petition, the petitioner should provide documentation for both passports or travel documents to establish that the passport or travel document was valid at the time of registration and an explanation as to why there was a change in identifying information.\nIn rare instances, such as for nationals of Venezuela, the passport or travel document may be past the expiration date listed on the document (that is, facially expired) but may have had its validity extended by decree or automatically by the national government or issuing authority that issued the passport or travel document. In these unusual circumstances, we would consider those documents to be valid since they were extended by decree or automatically.​ Registrants should enter the expiration date of the passport or travel document based on the extension, rather than the date that appears in the passport itself. If an H-1B petition is filed based on such registration, we will review the copy of the facially expired document along with any relevant information about the extension to ensure the information entered at registration was accurate.\nQ. Is there an appeal process for registrations that USCIS finds are invalid duplicates?\nA. We will invalidate duplicate registrations by the same registrant. A registrant will not be able to appeal our finding that the registrations are duplicates.\nQ. If registering for the master’s cap based on the expectation that the beneficiary will earn a qualifying advanced degree and the registration is selected under the master’s cap, but the beneficiary does not obtain their qualifying advanced degree by the time of filing the cap-subject H-1B petition, is there a risk that USCIS will deny the cap-subject H-1B petition for that beneficiary?\nA. If we select a registration under the advanced degree exemption (under INA 214(g)(5)(C)) because the beneficiary has earned, or will earn before the filing of the petition, a master’s or higher degree from a U.S. institution of higher education, the beneficiary must be eligible for the advanced degree exemption at the time of filing Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker . If we select the beneficiary under the advanced degree exemption and the beneficiary has not earned a qualifying master’s or higher degree from a U.S. institution of higher education at the time of filing the petition, we will deny or reject the petition.\nQ. What happens if the prospective employer with a selected registration puts an address on their registration but moves before they file their I-129 petition, such that the addresses on their registration and Form I-129 don’t match?\nA. In such a situation, the petitioner should include a statement with their petition, with supporting documentation, explaining why the address on the registration differs from the address on the petition. If we cannot determine that the petitioning entity is the same as the prospective petitioner identified on the selected registration, we may reject or deny the petition.\nQ. What start date should petitioners with a selected registration indicate on their Form I-129?\nA. If we selected your registration, you must indicate a start date of Oct. 1 or later of the appropriate fiscal year (and 6 months or less from the receipt date of the petition) on your petition. If you do not, we will reject or deny your petition.\nQ. If there is a typo on the registration in comparison to the Form I-129, will USCIS reject the Form I-129 petition?\nA. Although we will not automatically reject the Form I-129 petition for typos on the selected registration in comparison with the Form I-129, the burden is on the registrant/petitioner to confirm that all registration and petition information is correct and to establish that the H-1B cap petition is based on a valid registration submitted for the beneficiary named in the petition and selected by USCIS.\nQ. Will the H-1B registration system or the beneficiary-centric selection process affect how USCIS handles the prohibited filing of multiple H-1B petitions for the same beneficiary by related entities?\nA. The prohibition on an employer or related entities filing multiple H-1B cap petitions for the same beneficiary has not changed. Our handling of multiple H-1B cap petitions is consistent with 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(G) and Matter of S- Inc., Adopted Decision 2018-02 (AAO Mar. 23, 2018).\nQ. Where should a petitioner with a selected registration file their Form I-129 and supporting documentation?\nA. We accept online filing for H-1B cap petitions and associated Forms I-907 for petitioners whose registrations have been selected. Petitioners also have the option of filing a paper Form I-129 H-1B petition and any associated Form I-907 if they prefer. However, users will not be able to link paper-filed Forms I-129 and I-907 to their online accounts.\nFor paper-filed forms, petitioners must file per the instructions on the H-1B registration selection notice, which may be different from the historical Form I-129 filing jurisdictions for cap cases. Please see our Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker webpage for information on the correct location at which to file your cap petition.\nQ. What happens if a legal representative submits a registration but then stops representing the registrant?\nA. It is up to the representative and registrant to ensure that the registrant maintains access to submissions made for them and any updates related to those submissions. If a registrant no longer wants their attorney involved, they can end the relationship with the representative, and the registrant will still be able to see all registration information in their own organizational account(s). However, the registrant will not be able to add a new attorney or representative to H-1B registrations prepared or submitted by the previous attorney.\nQ. Will the system prevent the representative and the registrant from both entering the same beneficiary?\nA. The system will not prevent a representative and a registrant from both registering the same beneficiary. However, we added duplicate checker functionality to the electronic registration process. Before you submit your registration(s), you can check whether the registrant named in the draft submission previously submitted a registration for any of the beneficiaries included in that draft submission for the same fiscal year. Using this check does not guarantee that you will not submit a duplicate. This check will compare the beneficiaries listed in the draft with any registrations previously submitted during this registration period. It will not check for duplicates within that draft or between drafts. Even when using this check function, the representative and the registrant are still responsible for ensuring that they do not submit duplicate registrations. To help with that, we also offer a tool to download a .csv file and search for duplicate entries. In addition, we recommend that attorneys and authorized individuals who work for the same company communicate among themselves to eliminate duplicates before submitting their registrations.\nQ. I am a legal representative submitting the H-1B registration online, and the Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative , asks if I have an online account and what my account number is. How do I find it?\nA. If you have paper-filed cases that are eligible to be added to your online account, your USCIS notices for those cases should include your online account number. If you do not know your account number, this will not affect your H-1B registration. You can click “No” to this question and move on to the next question.\nQ. Will both the attorney and the client (prospective registrant) need to create a USCIS online account for the H-1B electronic registration process?\nA. Yes. Both the client (prospective registrant) and attorney will need a USCIS online account for the H-1B electronic registration process. If you are an attorney and already have an existing legal representative account, your account will work with the H-1B electronic registration process. You do not need to create a new legal representative account unless you do not have one.\nAll clients (prospective registrants) will need to create an H-1B organizational account to review and approve the Form G-28 and H-1B registrations as part of the electronic registration process.\nQ. As a registrant, can I delete my account?\nA. See the Tips for Filing Forms Online webpage for information on how to delete your account.\nQ. Does a duplicate registration in a submission batch affect all registrations in the batch or only the duplicate registration?\nA. We would invalidate only the duplicate registrations. If you properly submitted other registrations for different beneficiaries, these valid registrations would remain in the system for the selection process. You have until the initial registration period closes, to log into your account, review all of your H-1B registrations, and delete any duplicate registrations. This is also true if one of the registrations submitted in a batch contains an error. You would be able to delete the registration for the beneficiary that contained the error without affecting the rest of the batch submission.\nQ. As a legal representative, how will I know that the registrant has gone into the system and approved my Form G-28 and the H-1B registrations?\nA. You can log into your account to check if the registrant has approved the Form G-28 and the H-1B registrations. Our system will not separately notify you that the registrant has approved the Form G-28 and H-1B registrations.\nQ. After the legal representative submits a registration, will the registrant be notified via email or by logging into their account?\nA. The legal representative will need to notify the registrant that the registration and Form G-28 were entered for the registrant’s review; or the registrant can see the registrations and Form G-28 by logging into their account. Our system will not separately notify the registrant.\nQ. Can an attorney represent a petitioner for a Form I-129 petition if the petitioner completed the H-1B electronic registration process without the help of the attorney?\nA. Yes. However, to authorize their representation, the attorney would need to file a Form G-28 with the Form I-129 H-1B petition. Even if the attorney submitted a Form G-28 to represent a registrant for the registration process, they would still need to submit a new Form G-28 with the Form I-129 petition.\nQ. How do I reset the password for my USCIS account or get technical support?\nA. To reset your password, please visit the Forgot Your Password page on our website. To review the steps on how to create an online account, sign into your account, or complete an H-1B registration with USCIS, please see the “How to Register” tab above. If you are experiencing technical difficulties with your online account or your H-1B registration, send us a message using the Request for Account Help Form . Select “A technical issue in my online account” from the drop-down menu. Be sure to include all requested information and indicate if your technical issue is related to H-1B registration.\nQ. What is the earliest date I can start drafting registrations?\nA. The FY 26 H-1B cap registration period opened on March 7, 2025, at noon Eastern. The FY 26 H-1B registration period closed on March 24, 2025, at noon Eastern.\nQ. Will the system allow multiple staff members to log into my account at the same time?\nA. No. You must agree to the Terms of Use, which include an attestation that you are the person that holds the account and that you will not share your account with others or allow others to use your account.\nHowever, we launched USCIS organizational accounts that allow multiple people within an organization and their legal representatives to collaborate on preparation of H-1B registrations, H-1B petitions, and any associated Form I-907.\nQ. How should a registrant with a selected registration notify USCIS if they do not intend to file a petition?\nA. Since no H-1B petition will be filed, we will have no paper file that we can use to match the registrant’s notification with the selected registration. We suggest that the employer keep documentation of the reason for not filing, so that the employer would be able to show us the documentation if we have questions.\nQ. If a registration is selected and the petition is filed during the 90-day period, but it is rejected, will a petitioner be eligible to refile if they are still within the 90-day window?\nA. A petitioner is eligible to refile their rejected petition if they refile it within the designated 90-day filing window. The petitioner must file their petition at the correct location and must include all required fees and supporting evidence with the filing.\nQ. What should I do if information from the delivery service suggests there may be a delay or damage to the package or that the package was misrouted?\nA. It is your burden to monitor the progress of your delivery, even if it is guaranteed by the delivery service. If you filed an H-1B cap petition in a timely manner, but information from the delivery service suggests that there may be a delay or damage to the package or that the package was misrouted, you may file a second H-1B petition with a new fee payment during the designated 90-day filing window on your Registration Selection Notice. You must include:\nAn explanation as to why a second petition is being filed, with supporting evidence, such as information from the delivery service; and\nA request to withdraw the first petition filed for the H-1B cap.\nIf you do not include these items, you will be considered to have submitted duplicate petitions. We may deny or revoke multiple or duplicative petitions filed by the same petitioner, for the same H-1B worker in the same fiscal year and will not refund the filing fees.\nHowever, if you properly file a second H-1B petition and withdraw the first, we will withdraw the first petition and proceed with adjudication of the second petition.\nQ. Will USCIS invalidate registrations as duplicates if the same representative submits two registrations for the same beneficiary, but for two unrelated companies?\nA. No. We would not consider such registrations duplicates. However, we will consider registrations as duplicates if the registrations are for the same prospective petitioners and the same prospective beneficiaries.\nFurthermore, we would consider a registration to not be properly submitted if it contained an attestation that was not true and correct (for example, that a company worked with another entity to submit multiple registrations for the same beneficiary to unfairly increase chances of selection for that beneficiary). For more information, please see the “Unfairly Increasing Chances of Selection” tab above.\nQ. If one person is the authorized signatory for two separate companies, could this person use their email with different domain names to set up a registrant account and submit registrations for the two companies?\nA. Yes, they may. They will need two separate accounts, one for each company. They will also need a separate email address for each account.\nQ. What happens to my registration submission if the payment fails to initially go through?\nA. If your payment initially fails or is canceled before it can be processed on Pay.gov, you will see a payment failure notification on the screen and your registration will not be submitted. Your registration data will be available in your account for 30 days from the date you last worked on your registrations. You can sign in to your account at any time before the initial registration period closes to try the payment and registration submission again. You must submit all registrations and payments successfully before the initial registration period closes for consideration in the initial registration period selection process\nQ. What happens if my payment initially clears, but then fails (for example, payment is made using an electronic check that my bank then returns)?\nA. It is your responsibility to submit valid payment.\nWhen paying by check, please be sure to enter the bank routing number and bank account number accurately. While the status of the registration in the system will indicate “submitted” following completion of the Pay.gov payment process, the submission will only be valid once your payment clears. If your checking account information is not accurate, your payment will be declined when presented to your financial institution. If your payment is declined, your H-1B registration will be invalidated.\nIf payment is made with a credit card or debit card, the status of the registration in the system will indicate “submitted” following completion of the Pay.gov payment process. The submission, however, will only be valid once processing of the payment is completed. If the payment is later declined, not reconciled, disputed, or otherwise invalidated after submission, the registration will be invalidated.\nIf your payment fails, we will attempt to notify you, but it is your responsibility to determine the status of your required payment. If your registration is invalidated while the registration period is still open, you will be able to submit a new registration with a valid payment. If your registration is invalidated due to a failed payment after the registration period closes, you will not be able to submit a new registration. We may deny or revoke the approval of an H-1B petition if we determine that the fee associated with the registration is declined, not reconciled, disputed, or otherwise invalid after submission. The registration fee is non-refundable and due at the time the registration is submitted.\nQ. May an authorized signatory within the company, who is different from the authorized signatory who signed the H-1B electronic registration, sign the paper Form I-129?\nA. Yes. The authorized signatory who signed the registration does not need to be the same authorized signatory who signs Form I-129. However, the prospective petitioner (registrant) at the registration stage must match the petitioner at the Form I-129 stage.\nQ. What time zone does the H-1B registration system and Form I-129 petitions submitted online use?\nA. H-1B registrations and Forms I-129 that are submitted online via a USCIS online account will reflect a filing time based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\nFor Form I-129 petitions submitted online, the receipt date will be based on UTC, not the local time of the submitter or the location of the officer that will ultimately work the petition. This may result in a later receipt date than anticipated if filing late in the day. Please verify that any filings are submitted on time to ensure that there are no adverse impacts to eligibility.\nQ. I indicated on a registration that a beneficiary was not eligible for the master’s cap, but their selection notice indicates they were selected in the master’s cap. Is this an error on the selection notice?\nA. First, you should verify your indication on the registration regarding the beneficiary’s eligibility for consideration in the master’s cap.\nHowever, even if you did not indicate the beneficiary was eligible for consideration in the master’s cap, they may still have been properly considered in the master’s cap. The beneficiary would have been entered into the master’s cap selection process if they had another registration submitted on their behalf that indicated they were eligible for consideration in the master’s cap. Because of the beneficiary-centric selection process, all registrations submitted for that beneficiary are selected if the beneficiary is selected. Accordingly, if the beneficiary was selected in the master’s cap, all registrations would indicate that selection, even if a particular registration did not indicate eligibility for the master’s cap.\nBased on DHS regulations, the general cap selection is conducted first by selecting beneficiaries from among all properly submitted registrations, including those eligible for the advanced degree exemption. Then the master’s cap selection is conducted. Accordingly, any beneficiary selected in the initial master’s cap selection was not selected in the initial general cap selection.\nYou are still eligible to file a petition based on this selected registration during the applicable filing period. However, you would need to establish the beneficiary’s eligibility for the master’s cap as of the time of filing the Form I-129 petition.\nOrganizational Accounts Frequently Asked Questions\nH-1B Registration Federal Register Notice\nH-1B Registration Final Rule (2019)\nH-1B Registration Final Rule (2024)",

    "title": "FAQs for Individuals in H-1B Nonimmigrant Status | USCIS",
    "content": "FAQs for Individuals in H-1B Nonimmigrant Status\nThe following information addresses common questions by individuals in H-1B nonimmigrant status, particularly related to applying for lawful permanent resident (LPR) status, job changes or terminations, international travel, and dependent family members.\nFor example, did you know:\nAn eligible H-1B worker can change employers as soon as the new employer’s nonfrivolous H-1B petition is properly filed with USCIS.\nWe will not revoke a Form I-140 petition approval solely due to the termination of the petitioner’s business or the employer’s withdrawal, as long as the petition has been approved for at least 180 days or the associated adjustment of status application has been pending for at least 180 days, and the petition approval is not revoked on other grounds. In this scenario, the H-1B worker will retain their priority date.\nWhen an H-1B worker’s employment is terminated (either voluntarily or involuntarily), they typically may take one of several actions to remain in a period of authorized stay in the United States beyond 60 days.\nThe chart below summarizes some common scenarios for H-1B workers. The information in this chart is general and does not capture all relevant details or considerations. Please review the FAQs further below and accompanying links for more specific information.\nQ. I am currently in the United States in another nonimmigrant status. Do I have to depart the United States to obtain H-1B nonimmigrant status?\nA. Nonimmigrants in the United States who wish to obtain a different nonimmigrant status generally either apply for a change of status with USCIS or, after USCIS approves their benefit request, consular process by applying for a visa in the new classification at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and then requesting admission to the United States in the new classification.\nIn general, you may change to H-1B nonimmigrant status without departing the United States. An employer who files an H-1B petition on your behalf can request a change of status on the Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker . To be eligible to change your status, you must have been lawfully admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant, your nonimmigrant status must remain valid, you must not have violated the conditions of your status, and you must not have committed any act that would make you ineligible to receive a nonimmigrant benefit. Also, certain nonimmigrant categories are ineligible for a change of status (see Change My Nonimmigrant Status for a list).\nIf you need to depart the United States - for example, if your current nonimmigrant status expires before your employer is able to file Form I-129 requesting a change of status to H-1B classification - you would generally need to apply for and obtain an H-1B visa stamp from a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and present yourself at a port of entry for admission in H-1B status with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) after the approval of the H-1B petition filed on your behalf. See Requirements to Timely File a Request to Extend Stay or Change Status in the USCIS Policy Manual .\nQ. How long may I remain in the United States in H-1B status?\nA. The maximum period of admission for H-1B workers is generally 6 years. However, as detailed below, there are some common exceptions to this limit.\nQ. When and how long can I extend my H-1B status beyond 6 years?\nA. Your employer may submit Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker , on your behalf, requesting an H-1B extension beyond 6 years in certain scenarios. For example, your employer may request to extend your H-1B status beyond 6 years if at least 365 days have passed since a permanent labor certification was filed on your behalf with the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) or since an immigrant visa petition (typically Form I-140), enabling you to apply for lawful permanent residence once a visa is available, was filed on your behalf with USCIS under one of the employment-based immigrant visa categories . We may grant extensions on this basis in up to 1-year increments.\nMore commonly, your employer may also request to extend H-1B status beyond 6 years if you are the beneficiary of an approved Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers , in the first, second, or third preference category and are eligible to be granted lawful permanent resident status, except for the fact that an immigrant visa is not available, as reflected in the U.S. Department of State Visa Bulletin . Your petitioning employer must demonstrate that the visa is not available as of the date the H-1B extension petition is filed with USCIS, a s determined by your Form I-140 priority date and the relevant visa bulletin chart from the time of filing the H-1B extension request. See the USCIS Policy Manual for additional information on visa availability. We may grant extensions on this basis in up to 3-year increments.\nAdditional information about extending H-1B status beyond 6 years, including specific requirements and points at which you are no longer eligible for such extensions, is available on our H-1B Specialty Occupations page under “Period of Stay.”\nQ. Must I presently hold H-1B status to request H-1B status beyond 6 years?\nA. You do not have to hold H-1B status at the time you request H-1B status beyond the sixth year. Regulations authorizing H-1B status beyond 6 years apply to individuals who are currently in or previously held H-1B status.\nFor example, imagine you previously held H-1B status for 6 years but had no basis to timely extend beyond 6 years before your 6 years in H-1B status were reached. You then changed to O-1 status. While in O-1 status, a Form I-140 petition in the first, second, or third preference category was approved on your behalf, but an immigrant visa is not available in the category under which you are adjusting status based on your priority date. Your employer may then file a petition requesting a 3-year period of H-1B status on your behalf. This petition could either request a change of status to H-1B while still in the United States, assuming you are otherwise eligible for a change of status, or consular notification. H-1B petitions approved by USCIS for consular processing are forwarded to the Department of State for review. After review, a U.S. Consulate or Embassy may issue a visa for travel to a United States’ port of entry.\nQ. Does my time outside of the United States count towards my 6-year maximum in H-1B status?\nA. Only time spent in the United States as an H-1B beneficiary counts towards the 6-year maximum. Time spent outside the United States exceeding 24 hours, commonly referred to as “recapture time” or “remainder time,” does not count towards your 6-year limit, and you are eligible to recapture those periods of time. The burden is on your petitioning employer to request and establish eligibility for recapture time. Documentation of time outside of the United States may include passport stamps, Form I-94 Arrival/Departure Records and travel history from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, airline tickets, and boarding passes, along with an accompanying chart indicating dates outside of the United States. Your petitioning employer may include such documentation to establish your eligibility for recapturing time when they submit an H-1B petition on your behalf.\nQ. I only work in H-1B status for short periods of time throughout the year. Does the 6-year maximum duration still apply to me?\nThere is not a limitation of stay if your employment in the United States is seasonal or intermittent or for a total of 6 months or less per year, or if you do not reside continually in the United States. Your petitioning employer must provide clear and convincing proof that you qualify for such an exception of the 6-year maximum duration. This proof must consist of evidence such as arrival and departure records, copies of tax returns, and records of employment abroad.\nQ. When can I begin a new 6-year period of H-1B status?\nA. You may be eligible to begin a new period of 6 years in H-1B status if you have been outside of the United States for 1 continuous year, with the exception of brief trips to the United States for business or pleasure. If you start a new 6-year period of H-1B status you are subject to H-1B cap limitations if your employment is cap-subject.\nQ. My H-1B status is about to expire. Do I have to leave the United States to extend my H-1B status?\nA. In general, you do not have to leave the United States to extend your H-1B status. Your employer can submit an H-1B petition with a request to extend your H-1B status. To be eligible to extend your status, you must have been lawfully admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant, your nonimmigrant status must remain valid, you must not have violated the conditions of your status, and you must not have committed any act that would make you ineligible to receive a nonimmigrant benefit.\nIf the H-1B petition requesting an extension of status on your behalf is filed after the end of your H-1B status period - in other words, if it was not “timely filed” -- then we, in our discretion and under certain conditions, may excuse the failure to timely file if the delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond your control. If we approve the late-filed petition to extend status, the approval is effective as of the date of the expiration of your prior H-1B admission period. See the USCIS Policy Manual .\nIf we deny the extension of status request, whether it was filed on time or not, you will be considered to have been out of valid status as of the expiration date of your H-1B status that you sought to extend (in other words, your I-94 expiration date). Please see the USCIS Policy Manual for more information.\nQ. My H-1B status is about to expire but a petition requesting an H-1B extension on my behalf is pending at USCIS. What is my status once my H-1B expires? May I continue to work while the extension request is pending?\nIf your H-1B expires and a timely-filed non-frivolous H-1B extension request is pending on your behalf, you are in a period of authorized stay - even after your H-1B status expires. Note, however, that an authorized period of stay is not the same as a status. If the petition is seeking extension of the same employment for the same employer, you are authorized to continue employment for a period not to exceed 240 days from the date your H-1B status expired. If we deny the extension request before the 240-day period expires, your employment authorization will automatically terminate when USCIS notifies your petitioning employer of the denial. If the petition is requesting a change in employment or change in employer under H-1B portability, you are authorized to work in the new employment for the entire time the petition is pending at USCIS. If we deny the request, your employment authorization based on portability will automatically terminate when USCIS notifies your petitioning employer of the denial. See “Changing Employers or Employment Terms with the Same Employer (Portability)” in our H-1B Specialty Occupation webpage.\nQ. What happens if my H-1B status expires while I have a pending application to change to another nonimmigrant status?\nA. A pending application to change status ( Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker , or Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status ) does not provide lawful immigration status. However, you may be in an authorized period of stay during the period when a timely filed nonfrivolous application to change status is pending with USCIS. If we approve your timely-filed application to change status, the start date for your new nonimmigrant status is effective on the date of approval. If there is a gap of time between the expiration date of your H-1B status and the start date of your new status, we consider you to have continued to maintain a lawful status as long as you timely filed the change of status (COS) application, we granted the request to change status, and you did not violate any terms and conditions of your H-1B status.\nIf your request to change status was not filed on time - in other words, if it was not filed before the end of your H-1B status -- then we, in our discretion and under certain conditions, may excuse the failure to timely file if the delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond your control. If we approve the late filed change of status application, the change of status takes effect on the approval date. In this scenario, we will consider you to have maintained lawful status during the excused period. See the USCIS Policy Manual .\nIf we deny the application to change status, whether it was filed on time or not, you will be considered to have been out of valid status as of the expiration date of your H-1B status (your I-94 expiration date).\nQ. What happens if my H-1B status expires and I have an approved compelling circumstances Employment Authorization Document (EAD)?\nA. If your H-1B status expires and you have a compelling circumstances EAD, you will be in a period of authorized stay, but you will no longer be maintaining a nonimmigrant status. You generally will not accrue unlawful presence in the United States while the EAD is valid or, if you filed a non-frivolous application for the EAD before the expiration of your H-1B status, while your application was pending.\nIf you are working in the United States under a compelling circumstances EAD and a nonimmigrant or immigrant petition is filed on your behalf, you would not be eligible to change status, extend status, or adjust status to lawful permanent resident from within the United States. After the petition is approved, you would need to apply for a visa and/or admission from outside the United States to begin working in accordance with that petition.\nSee additional information at Employment Authorization in Compelling Circumstances .\nQ. I have a controlling interest in a company. Can this company qualify as my petitioning employer to sponsor my H-1B status?\nA. A company in which you have a controlling interest - meaning, you own more than 50% or have majority voting rights in the company - may qualify as your employer and may petition for H-1B status on your behalf. In this scenario you would be both an owner of the petitioning employer and a beneficiary of the petition (a “beneficiary owner”). You must still be coming temporarily to the United States to perform services in a specialty occupation. As a beneficiary owner, you must perform specialty occupation duties a majority of the time and may otherwise perform non-specialty occupation duties that are directly related to owning and directing your company, along with some incidental duties. The validity periods for the initial petition and first extension of such petition for beneficiary owners are limited to 18 months each. Additionally, Department of Labor requirements related to Labor Condition Applications, including requirements concerning the appropriate prevailing wage, still apply.\nSee the final rule, Modernizing H-1B Requirements, Providing Flexibility in the F-1 Program, and Program Improvements Affecting Other Nonimmigrant Workers , published on Dec. 18, 2024, which clarifies how the H-1B regulations apply to beneficiary owners.\nThe United States remains a destination for top talent around the world. Our ability to attract and retain entrepreneurs is essential for spurring innovation, job creation, and new industries and opportunities for all Americans. We encourage entrepreneurs to use the H-1B program, or other appropriate pathways, to live and work in the United States. See Options for Alien Entrepreneurs to Work in the United States .\nQ. I hold H-1B status and have a pending adjustment of status application. If my H-1B expires, will my adjustment of status application be denied?\nA.A pending adjustment of status application does not provide lawful status or cure any violation of nonimmigrant visa status. If you file Form I-485 while you are in H-1B status, however, the expiration of that H-1B status while the Form I-485 is pending generally will not make you ineligible for adjustment of status, as long as you do not engage in unauthorized employment or otherwise become inadmissible. See the USCIS Policy Manual .\nQ. I hold H-1B status and have a pending adjustment of status application. If my H-1B expires, may I continue to work and travel?\nA. A pending Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status , does not automatically confer employment authorization and does not serve as a basis for readmission to the United States. However, you may submit applications for employment authorization and advance parole with your Form I-485. If you file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization , based on your pending Form I-485, and receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), you may use this EAD to work. EADs based on a pending adjustment of status application are unrestricted as to employment type and location. If you file Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records , and receive an Advance Parole Document based on your pending Form I-485, you may present your valid Advance Parole Document at a port of entry for reentry to the United States.\nThe validity period for your EAD will generally be 5 years . If you file both Form I-131 and Form I-765 and USCIS approves both applications, we will generally issue one document which serves as both your EAD and Advance Parole Document (known as a combination card, or combo card). The combo card will be an EAD with the notation “SERVES AS I-512 ADVANCE PAROLE.” (See Information About Your Immigration Document .) If you do not file the Form I-131 and I-765 together, and/or if we cannot adjudicate both applications together, you will receive separate employment authorization and Advance Parole Documents. In this case, your EAD will indicate “NOT VALID FOR REENTRY TO U.S.” and your Advance Parole Document will be issued separately.\nQ. I am an foreign student on an F-1 visa, currently in a period of optional practical training (OPT). Do I need to obtain H-1B status for my employer to file an immigrant petition on my behalf?\nA. As an F-1 student on OPT, you do not have to obtain H-1B status before an immigrant petition is filed on your behalf. In general, nonimmigrants are admitted for a specific temporary period of time and, at the time of admission or extension of stay, must intend to depart the United States at the expiration of their authorized period of admission or extension of stay. See the USCIS Policy Manual . To be eligible for F-1 classification, a student must intend to depart the United States after their temporary period of stay and have a foreign residence they do not intend to abandon. However, as a student you may be the beneficiary of a pending or approved immigrant petition and still be able to demonstrate an intent to depart. See the USCIS Policy Manual .\nQ. I have an approved immigrant petition and am waiting for a visa number to be available. Why is there such a long wait for a visa number to be available to me?\nA. Availability of immigrant visas is subject to statutory limits, and demand for these visas is generally much higher than the limits can accommodate. Statutory constraints on immigrant visa numbers can only be changed by Congress. See Employment-Based Adjustment of Status FAQs for additional information.\nQ. I have now become a lawful permanent resident. Do any employment restrictions apply to me? What guidance is available?\nA. As a lawful permanent resident you are authorized to work for any employer. You may use your Permanent Resident Card (Green Card) for readmission to the United States after travel abroad, though if you are outside of the country for a long duration - generally 1 year or more - you may need to apply for a reentry permit. Note that, depending on the length and circumstances of the trip abroad, the trip may lead to a determination that you have abandoned your lawful permanent resident status. (See the USCIS Policy Manual ). Additional conditions and requirements apply to those granted conditional permanent resident status, usually granted to those who applied for lawful permanent residence based on marriage or investment. See After We Grant Your Green Card for more detailed information and resources.\nQ. What is “porting”?\nA. There are two kinds of job portability, or “porting,” available based on two different kinds of employer petitions:\nH-1B petition portability : Eligible H-1B nonimmigrants may begin working for a new employer as soon as the employer properly files a new H-1B petition (Form I-129) requesting to amend or extend H-1B status with USCIS, without waiting for the petition to be approved. More information about H-1B portability can be found on our H-1B Specialty Occupations page.\nImmigrant worker petition portability : A worker with an adjustment of status application (Form I-485) that has been pending for at least 180 days with an underlying valid immigrant visa petition (Form I-140) can transfer the underlying immigrant visa petition to a qualifying new offer of employment in the same or similar occupational classification with the same or a new employer. For example, if you move from a software developer position to an information systems manager position, this may be considered a same or similar occupation. More information about this kind of porting (sometimes known as “ INA 204(j) portability”) can be found in the USCIS Policy Manual .\nIf you seek to port to a new offer of employment under INA 204(j), you must submit Form I-485 Supplement J, Confirmation of Bona Fide Job Offer or Request for Job Portability Under INA Section 204(j) , to document your new job offer and transfer your Form I-140 to the new job offer.\nIf the Form I-140 is in an employment-based immigrant visa category which does not require a job offer - namely, individuals seeking a national interest waiver of the job offer requirement or individuals seeking classification as a person of extraordinary ability - you do not need to request job portability under INA 204(j).\nEligibility for immigrant visa classifications and specific requirements are described in the USCIS Policy Manual and in the Employment-Based Adjustment of Status FAQs .\nQ. How do I leave my current employer to start working for a new employer while remaining in H-1B status?\nA. Under H-1B portability provisions, you may begin working for a new employer as soon as they properly file a non-frivolous H-1B petition on your behalf, or as of the requested start date on the petition, whichever is later. You are not required to wait for the new employer’s H-1B petition to be approved before beginning to work for the new employer, assuming certain conditions are met. For more details about H-1B portability, see our H-1B Specialty Occupations page, under “Changing Employers or Employment Terms with the Same Employer (Portability).”\nQ. What are my options if my H-1B employment is terminated?\nA. When nonimmigrant workers are laid off, they may not be aware of their options and may, in some instances, wrongly assume that they have no option but to leave the country within 60 days.\nIf your employment is terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, you typically may take one of the following actions, if you are eligible, to remain in a period of authorized stay in the United States:\nFile an application for a change of nonimmigrant status;\nFile an application for adjustment of status;\nFile an application for a compelling circumstances Employment Authorization Document; or\nBe the beneficiary of a nonfrivolous petition to change employer.\nIf one of these actions occurs within the up to 60-day grace period, your period of authorized stay in the United States can exceed 60 days, even if you lose your previous nonimmigrant status. If you take no action within the grace period, you and your dependents may then need to depart the United States within 60 days, or when your authorized validity period ends, whichever is shorter.\nFor more detailed information, see our page on Options for Nonimmigrant Workers Following Termination of Employment .\nQ. My employer filed a Form I-140 immigrant worker petition on my behalf. What happens if I leave my job, or if my employer withdraws the Form I-140? Will I retain my priority date? Am I still eligible to adjust status?\nA. First, let’s assume that your priority date is not yet current (meaning it is not earlier than the applicable cutoff date in the Visa Bulletin).\nStarting from the moment that the Form I-140 filed on your behalf is approved:\nYour priority date is generally locked in for use in subsequently filed Form I-140 petitions (also known as priority date retention). The only way you can lose your priority date is if the I-140 approval is revoked on certain grounds such as agency error, fraud, or willful misrepresentation of a material fact.\nIf you are otherwise eligible for H-1B status, this I-140 approval may be the basis to extend your H-1B status beyond the general 6-year period of admission limitation, in up to 3-year increments.\nYour spouse, if in H-4 nonimmigrant status or seeking a change of status to H-4 nonimmigrant status, would be eligible to apply for an Employment Authorization Document.\nWithin 180 days of the Form I-140 approval, if your employer withdraws the I-140 petition approval that was filed on your behalf, USCIS is obligated to automatically revoke the I-140 approval. You would not lose your priority date , but you would need a new basis in order to extend your H-1B status beyond the general 6-year limitation and ultimately adjust status.\nAfter the Form I-140 filed on your behalf has been approved for at least 180 days, however:\nEven if your employer withdraws the Form I-140 approval, USCIS would not revoke the I-140 approval for that reason alone. You would continue to have an approved I-140, and would continue to be eligible for H-1B extensions beyond the general 6-year limitation if you are otherwise eligible for H-1B status. USCIS would only revoke the I-140 approval on certain grounds such as agency error, fraud, or misrepresentation of a material fact. You would, however, need a new basis on which to seek adjustment of status.\nNext, let’s assume that your priority date becomes current, you have an approved I-140, and you properly file Form I-485 (the application to adjust status).\nOnce your Form I-485 has been pending for 180 days, you can “port” the offer of employment in the Form I-140 approval to a new job offer (same or different employer) as long as the new job offer is in a “same or similar” occupational classification when compared to the job offer in the Form I-140 petition. The new employer does not have to submit a new I-140 on your behalf, although you would need to file a “ Supplement J ” to request this job portability. (Technically, you can submit a Supplement J to port a pending I-140 even before it’s approved, but this scenario is less common. See the relevant form instructions on when you must submit a Supplement J.)\nFinally, let’s consider one alternative scenario: More than 365 days have passed since the filing of a PERM labor certification application or a Form I-140 petition on your behalf:\nYou are eligible to extend your H-1B status beyond the general 6-year limitation, in up to 1-year increments. (As described above, the 3-year increments are only possible with an approved I-140 and a priority date that is not current.) Thus, even if you are not eligible for the up to 3-year extension because your priority date is current, you may still be eligible for extensions in increments of up to 1 year if at least 365 days have passed since the filing of the PERM labor certification application or Form I-140 petition (or other employment-based immigrant petition, such as Form I-360) on your behalf.\nYour spouse, if in H-4 nonimmigrant status or seeking a change of status to H-4 nonimmigrant status, would be eligible to apply for an Employment Authorization Document if you have been granted an extension beyond the end of the general 6-year limitation on this basis.\nQ. My employer filed a Form I-140 on my behalf, but I would now like to leave that employer and focus on my start-up company. Is it possible to “port” to self-employment and still adjust status?\nA. If you are the beneficiary of an approved Form I-140 petition or a pending Form I-140 petition that is ultimately approved and you have an adjustment of status application (Form I-485) that has been pending for at least 180 days, you may be able to port the offer of employment on which your application was based to self-employment in the same or similar occupational classification by filing a request to port using Form I-485 Supplement J. The petition must be in the employment-based 1st, 2nd, or 3rd preference category.\nTo determine if the self-employment is in the same or similar occupational classification as the job listed on the petition, USCIS evaluates the totality of the circumstances and may consider and compare various factors and evidence relating to the jobs, including the U.S. Department of Labor occupational codes assigned to the respective jobs; job duties; job titles; the required skills and experience; the educational and training requirements; any licenses or certifications specifically required; the offered wage or salary; and any other material and credible evidence relevant to a determination of whether the new position is in the same or a similar occupational classification.\nYour request to port should also contain sufficient evidence to confirm that your business and the new job offer are legitimate. If the submitted evidence is insufficient, or if the officer identifies indicators that raise doubts about the legitimacy of the self-employment, the officer may request additional evidence from you.\nIn reviewing a request to port, USCIS considers whether the petition accurately represented the intended employment at the time both the petition and the adjustment application were filed. This means that, at the time the petition was filed and at the time the adjustment application was filed (if not filed concurrently), the original petitioner must have intended to employ you in a permanent position, and you must also have intended to undertake the employment upon adjustment.\nSee the USCIS Policy Manual for additional information on porting and considerations for the same or similar occupational classification analysis.\nQ. I have an approved Form I-140 but I know I will be waiting a long time for an immigrant visa to become available. Do I need to be the beneficiary of a valid, approved Form I-140 for the whole time I’m waiting?\nA. You are not required to be the beneficiary of a valid, approved Form I-140 for the entire time you are waiting for an immigrant visa to become available. Generally, your first approved Form I-140 establishes your priority date. You do need a valid Form I-140 once an immigrant visa becomes available and you file your Form I-485, but it does not need to be the same I-140 that you used to establish your priority date.\nIn other words, an H-1B worker could establish their priority date with an approved I-140 from Employer A, then use H-1B petition portability to work for a number of other employers who do not file an I-140, and ultimately apply to adjust status based on a second approved I-140 from Employer Z (or use the approved I-140 from Employer A to “port” to a same or similar job offer from Employer Z, if eligible).\nPlease see the previous Q&A for more details about these scenarios.\nQ. I believe my employer has retaliated against me. What protections are available to me?\nA. You have a right to be protected from retaliation regardless of your immigration status. Immigration law may provide certain protections to you as an H-1B worker if you report suspected fraud or abuse. Normally, H-1B workers are not eligible to extend or change their status if they have lost or failed to maintain their H-1B status. However, if they can demonstrate “extraordinary circumstances,” we may use our discretion to excuse this requirement on a case-by-case basis. We may consider a situation to be an instance of “extraordinary circumstances” if you:\napply to extend your H-1B status or change your nonimmigrant status,\nindicate that you faced retaliatory action from your employer because you reported a Labor Condition Application violation,\nprovide credible documentary evidence of such a report and retaliation, and\nlost or failed to maintain your H-1B status.\nFor more details, see Combating Fraud and Abuse in the H-1B Visa Program .\nFor more general information on worker protections, visit Worker.gov .\nFor additional information about protection for alien workers who are involved in labor agency investigations, see DHS Support of the Enforcement of Labor and Employment Laws .\nQ. My employer filed an H-1B petition on my behalf, and it is pending at USCIS. If I travel internationally, will the H-1B petition be affected?\nA. Only a beneficiary who is continuing to maintain nonimmigrant status may apply for a change of status. If you depart the United States while a petition requesting a change of status to H-1B is pending, we will consider the change of status request abandoned. If we approve the petition, the approval notice will be issued as a consular notification and will not confer H-1B status. In this scenario, you would generally need to apply for and obtain an H-1B visa stamp from a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and present yourself for admission to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to obtain H-1B status. See the U.S. Department of State website for information on the visa application process and the CBP website for information on travel to the United States.\nYou must be physically present in the United States at the time your employer files a petition requesting an extension of stay on your behalf. However, departure from the United States while an H-1B petition requesting an extension of stay is pending will generally not serve as a basis to deny the extension request. Your employer may request that USCIS send notification of the H-1B extension approval to the consular office abroad where you will apply for a visa.\nQ. I am in the process of applying for lawful permanent resident status while holding H-1B status. Will international travel affect my adjustment of status application?\nA. For most adjustment of status applicants, if you depart the United States with a pending Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status , without first obtaining an advance parole document, we will deny Form I-485 for abandonment. Exceptions to this rule exist for a narrow set of nonimmigrants, including those holding valid H-1B status. An individual in H-1B status who is not under exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings may travel while Form I-485 is pending without first obtaining an advance parole document if:\nUpon returning to the United States they remain eligible for H-1B status;\nThey are returning to the United States to resume employment with the same employer for which their H-1B is authorized; and\nThey are in possession of a valid H-1B visa.\nAlternatively, an individual in H-1B status who has a pending Form I-485 and who has been granted an Advance Parole Document based on an approved Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records may depart the United States without abandoning their Form I-485 application, so long as they depart and return during the advance parole document’s validity period.\nQ. I filed Form I-131 requesting advance parole and Form I-765 requesting employment authorization with my Form I-485. If I leave the United States before the advance parole and employment authorization are issued, will the applications be denied?\nA. Departure from the United States generally will not on its own serve as a basis of denial of Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization , or Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records .\nYou may be eligible for expedited processing of your applications. We consider expedited processing of Form I-131 if you have a pressing or critical need to travel for an unexpected event, such as the need to obtain medical treatment in a limited time or the death or grave illness of a family member or close friend. Expedited processing of a travel document may also be warranted if you have a pressing or critical need to travel outside the United States for a planned event, such as a work or professional commitment, academic commitment, or personal commitment, but processing times prevent USCIS from issuing the travel document by the planned date of departure. When the need to expedite issuance of a travel document is related to a planned event, we consider whether you timely filed the Form I-131 or timely responded to a request for evidence. A desire to travel solely for vacation generally does not meet the definition of a pressing or critical need to travel. See additional information in the USCIS Policy Manual and our webpage on Expedite Requests .\nQ. I have an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) based on compelling circumstances and am no longer maintaining H-1B status. Can I travel outside the United States?\nA. An EAD based on compelling circumstances does not serve as a travel document or otherwise provide eligibility for readmission into the United States. However, having an EAD based on compelling circumstances does not prevent you from applying for a nonimmigrant or immigrant visa at a consular post outside the United States to return to the United States, assuming you are otherwise eligible.\nWe consider an applicant with a valid EAD based on compelling circumstances to be in a period of authorized stay. In addition, we consider the time during which the EAD application was pending to be a period of authorized stay. Therefore, you generally do not accrue unlawful presence during the validity period of the EAD or during the time that a timely filed non-frivolous application is pending. Leaving the United States to apply for a nonimmigrant or immigrant visa at a consular post outside the United States while working using the compelling circumstances-based EAD will not trigger the unlawful presence grounds of inadmissibility, if you are not subject to those grounds of inadmissibility from other circumstances. See additional information at Employment Authorization in Compelling Circumstances .\nQ. Can my H-4 dependent family members work?\nA. H-4 dependents are not automatically employment authorized on the basis of their nonimmigrant status. Only H-4 dependents who affirmatively apply for and receive employment authorization from USCIS are authorized to work, and only certain H-4s are eligible for employment authorization. H-4 spouses may file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization , if the H-1B worker is the beneficiary of an approved Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers , or has been granted H-1B status beyond 6 years based on 365 days having passed since a labor certification was filed with the Department of Labor or an immigrant visa petition was filed with USCIS on the H-1B worker’s behalf. See Employment Authorization for Certain H-4 Dependent Spouses .\nQ. Are my H-4 dependent family members also subject to the 6-year maximum period of stay?\nA. Dependent family members’ time in H-4 status is generally limited to the duration of the H-1B worker’s status. If an individual obtains H-1B extensions beyond 6 years, then their H-4 dependent family members are also eligible for extension of H-4 status for that same duration. Time spent in H-4 status does not count towards the 6-year maximum for H-1B status, so an individual who has spent 6 years in H-4 status my still obtain their own H-1B status for a period of 6 years.\nQ. I am seeking lawful permanent resident status with my dependent family members, including my H-4 child. What happens when my H-4 child turns 21? Are they still eligible for LPR status?\nA. Once your child turns 21 or gets married, they no longer meet the definition of a child under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and therefore will no longer be eligible for H-4 status. At this point, to maintain nonimmigrant status your child would need to change to another nonimmigrant status - for example, F-1 or H-1B - for which they independently qualify.\nAdditionally, they may still be eligible to adjust status or apply for an immigrant visa under the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA), which protects certain beneficiaries from losing eligibility for adjustment of status and immigrant visas due to aging during the immigration process. If your child benefits from the CSPA, they will still lose their H-4 status after turning 21, but they will remain eligible to adjust status as a derivative beneficiary of your own adjustment of status application and immigrant worker petition despite being age 21 or over, assuming otherwise eligible. See the USCIS Policy Manual for detailed information about CSPA, as well as Employment-Based Adjustment of Status FAQs (Family Members).\nQ. What actions has USCIS taken to support H-1B nonimmigrants seeking to adjust or change status in the United States?\nCongress sets the annual immigrant visa limits . Historically, demand for these visas, regardless of country of origin, is much higher than the annual limits can accommodate.\nUSCIS has taken several actions to help those who will be waiting a long time for an “immediately available” immigrant visa number, including a 2015 rule that allows certain spouses of H-1B nonimmigrants to apply for employment authorization, and a 2016 rule that has improved job flexibility for H-1B workers and their families.\nMore recent improvements since 2021 include the following:\nOperational improvements\nIn coordination with the Department of State, using all available employment-based visas for fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, apart from those visas that Congress has allowed to carry over to the employment-based visa limit for the following fiscal year.\nIncreasing the maximum validity period of Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) to 5 years for adjustment of status applicants and bringing back “combo cards” that provide evidence of both employment authorization and advance parole.\nExpanding premium processing to all filers of Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers, as well as certain filers of Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status.\nUpdating policy guidance on expedite requests , including when USCIS may expedite adjudication of an Application for Travel Document (Form I-131) when an applicant demonstrates a pressing or critical need to leave the United States, whether the need to travel relates to a planned or unplanned event. In addition, the guidance clarifies expedite requests supported by a government agency .\nRemoving the biometrics fee and appointment requirement for applicants for a change or extension of nonimmigrant status (Form I-539).\nAnnouncing process enhancements for deferred action requests by workers , including H-1B workers, to support labor and employment agency investigations.\nMaking progress on reducing processing times.\nPolicy improvements\nOn Dec. 18, DHS published a final rule to improve the H-1B program by modernizing and providing program efficiencies, increasing benefits and flexibilities, and strengthening integrity measures. Among other provisions, this rule revises the definition of and criteria for specialty occupation positions to codify current practice; codifies the deference policy under which adjudicators generally should defer to a prior determination when no underlying facts have changed; modernizes H-1B cap exemptions; extends “cap-gap” protections for F-1 students changing status to H-1B; codifies H-1B eligibility for beneficiary owners; and implements a number of integrity measures pertaining to site visits and third-party placements.\nStrengthening the integrity of the H-1B program with a final rule that created a new beneficiary-centric selection process for the FY 2025 H-1B registration period. This new rule has resulted in dramatically fewer attempts to game the system, as evidenced by H-1B registration data . In addition, under the new beneficiary-centric selection process, if a worker has multiple legitimate job offers and any of these registrations are selected, then the worker may choose which employer to work for.\nUpdating policy guidance for foreign students , including clarification that F and M students must have a foreign residence that they do not intend to abandon, but that such students may be the beneficiary of a permanent labor certification application or immigrant visa petition and may still be able to demonstrate their intention to depart after a temporary period of stay. In addition, the guidance specifies how F students seeking an extension of optional practical training (OPT) based on their degree in a STEM field may be employed by startup companies, as long as the employer adheres to the training plan requirements, remains in good standing with E-Verify, and provides compensation commensurate to that provided to similarly situated U.S. workers, among other requirements.\nUpdating the agency’s interpretation of the Child Status Protection Act to provide additional protection for child beneficiaries of alien workers from “aging out” of child status and allowing them to seek permanent residence along status with their parents, including clarification of the “sought to acquire” requirement .\nPublishing updated guidance on when a Form I-140 beneficiary may transfer, or “port,” to a new job, providing clarity to those seeking to change employers during the lengthy process of becoming a lawful permanent resident.\nGreater clarity\nPublishing resources for nonimmigrant workers following termination of employment , to ensure that nonimmigrant workers who are laid off are aware of options that may permit them to remain in the country past the regular 60 day grace period.\nIssuing guidance on the eligibility criteria for compelling circumstances Employment Authorization Documents (EADs). For example, a principal applicant with an approved immigrant visa petition in an oversubscribed visa category or chargeability area, who has lived in the United States for a significant amount of time, could submit evidence such as school or higher education enrollment records, mortgage records, or long-term lease records to support a potential finding of compelling circumstances. Compelling circumstances could include, if, due to job loss, the family may otherwise be forced to sell their home for a loss, pull their children out of school, and relocate to their home country.\nPublishing information on the full range of options for STEM professionals and entrepreneurs to work in the United States, and issuing new policy guidance to provide clarity for: Individuals of extraordinary ability ( O-1 ) Individuals of extraordinary ability and outstanding professors and researchers ( EB-1 ) Individuals with advanced degrees or exceptional ability who can self-petition with a National Interest Waiver ( EB-2 NIW ) Start-up founders growing their companies in the United States under the International Entrepreneur Rule .\nIndividuals of extraordinary ability ( O-1 )\nIndividuals of extraordinary ability and outstanding professors and researchers ( EB-1 )\nIndividuals with advanced degrees or exceptional ability who can self-petition with a National Interest Waiver ( EB-2 NIW )\nStart-up founders growing their companies in the United States under the International Entrepreneur Rule .\nMeanwhile, the Department of State has launched an Early Career STEM Research Initiative as part of the J-1 visa program, as well as a domestic visa renewal pilot program.\nWe will keep working within our legal authority to provide as much flexibility, predictability, and dignity as possible for all those waiting for their chance to become a lawful permanent resident and ultimately a U.S. citizen.\nH-1B Specialty Occupations\nEmployment-Based Adjustment of Status FAQs\nEmployment Authorization for Certain H-4 Dependent Spouses .\nEmployment Authorization in Compelling Circumstances\nOptions for Nonimmigrant Workers Following Termination of Employment\nOptions for Alien STEM Professionals to Work in the United States\nOptions for Alien Entrepreneurs to Work in the United States",

    "content": "Employment Authorization for Certain H-4 Dependent Spouses\nCertain H-4 dependent spouses of H-1B nonimmigrants can file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization , if the H-1B nonimmigrant:\nIs the principal beneficiary of an approved Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker ; or\nHas been granted H-1B status under sections 106(a) and (b) of the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000 as amended by the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act (AC21).\nU.S. businesses use the H-1B program to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require a bachelor’s or higher degree in a specific specialty that is directly related to the H-1B position. In addition to specialty occupation workers, the H-1B classification applies to individuals performing services related to a Department of Defense cooperative research and development project or coproduction project, and to individuals performing services of distinguished merit and ability in the field of fashion modeling.\nVisit our H-1B Visa page for more information on eligibility for the H-1B program.\nYou are eligible if you are the H-4 dependent spouse of an H-1B nonimmigrant if your H-1B nonimmigrant spouse:\nIs the principal beneficiary of an approved Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers ; or\nHas been granted H-1B status under sections 106(a) and (b) of AC21. Under AC21, H-1B nonimmigrants seeking employment-based lawful permanent residence may be eligible to work and remain in the United States beyond the six-year H-1B period of admission limitation.\nYou must file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization , to request employment authorization as an H-4 dependent spouse. You must receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD/Form I-766) from USCIS before you may begin working. Use the newest version of Form I-765 to prevent delays or the need for USCIS to issue you a request for evidence.\nCarefully follow these steps to prevent your application from being rejected and returned to you:\nComplete Form I-765 using the Instructions for Form I-765 . USCIS will reject any application that is not accompanied by the proper filing fees or signature. If you are filing Form I-765 together with Form I-485, you must specify your eligibility category as (c)(9), not as (c)(26), and pay the Form I-485 filing fee. Follow the Form I-485 filing instructions to avoid processing delays. If you file a Form I-765 together with a Form I-485 at the filing address for Form I-765 category (c)(26), USCIS will reject your Form I-485 and any corresponding fees. Additionally, if you included the fees for both forms on the same check or money order, USCIS may also reject your Form I-765 for category (c)(26).\nIf you are filing Form I-765 together with Form I-485, you must specify your eligibility category as (c)(9), not as (c)(26), and pay the Form I-485 filing fee.

Submitting sufficient supporting evidence will minimize the likelihood that USCIS will need to send you a request for more evidence.\nA copy of your current Form I-797 approval notice for Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status; or\nA copy of Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, showing your admission as an H-4 nonimmigrant or your most recent approved extension of stay.\nA copy of your last EAD (if any);\nA copy of the biometric page of your passport;\nA birth certificate with photo ID;\nA visa issued by a foreign consulate; or\nA national identity document with photo.\nA copy of your marriage certificate.\nEvidence that the H-1B nonimmigrant is the principal beneficiary of an approved Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker.\nYou may show this by submitting a copy of the approval notice (Form I-797) for the Form I-140 filed for the H-1B nonimmigrant;\nOR\nEvidence that the H-1B nonimmigrant has been admitted or granted an extension of stay under AC21 sections 106(a) and (b).\nYou may show this by submitting:\nA copy of the H-1B nonimmigrant’s passports, prior Forms I-94 (Arrival/Departure Record), and current and prior Forms I-797 for Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; and\nEvidence to establish one of the following bases for the H-1B nonimmigrant’s extension of stay.\nBased on Filing of a Permanent Labor Certification Application. Submit evidence that the H-1B nonimmigrant is the beneficiary of a Permanent Labor Certification Application that was filed at least 365 days before the period of admission authorized under AC21 106(a) and (b) begins. You may show this by submitting a copy of a print out from the Department of Labor’s (DOL’s) website or other correspondence from DOL showing the status of the H-1B nonimmigrant’s Permanent Labor Certification Application. If more than 180 days have passed since DOL certified the Permanent Labor Certification Application, also submit a copy of Form I-797 Notice of Receipt for Form I-140 establishing that the Form I-140 was filed within 180 days of such DOL certification;\nOR\nBased on a Pending Form I-140. Submit evidence that the H-1B nonimmigrant’s Form I-140 was filed at least 365 days before the period of admission authorized under AC21 106(a) and (b) begins. You may show this by submitting a copy of the Form I-797, Notice of Receipt, for Form I-140.\nExamples of Secondary Evidence. If you do not have any evidence relating to the H-1B nonimmigrant as described in “a” or “b” above, you may ask USCIS to consider secondary evidence in support of your application for employment authorization as an H-4 spouse. For example, such information may include the receipt number of the most current Form I-129 extension of stay request filed for the H-1B nonimmigrant or the receipt number of the approved Form I-140 petition filed for the H-1B nonimmigrant. Failure to provide necessary information about the H-1B nonimmigrant may result in a delay in the adjudication or denial of your application for employment authorization.\nTwo identical two-by-two-inch passport-style color photographs of yourself\nIf you submit any documents containing a foreign language to USCIS, you must also submit a full English language translation that the translator has certified as complete and accurate. The translator must also certify that they are competent to translate from the foreign language into English.\nWhen filing Form I-765, please mail it to the proper location based on the chart below.\nFor your convenience, you may file Form I-765 with Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, or with both Form I-539 and the Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, filed for the H-1B principal nonimmigrant. However, we will not make a decision on your Form I-765 until after we have adjudicated your Form I-539 and determined whether you are eligible for the underlying H-4 nonimmigrant status, whether your spouse is eligible for the underlying H-1B nonimmigrant status, or both. Go to the Filing Form I-765 with Other Forms page for more information on filing these forms together\nYou will not be authorized to work until USCIS approves your Form I-765. Once your employment authorization is approved, the expiration date on your Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766 EAD) should be the same date as the expiration date on your most recent Form I-94 indicating your H-4 nonimmigrant status. Generally, you are only authorized to work through the expiration date on your EAD. If you are still eligible for employment authorization after that date, you should file for a renewal EAD by submitting another Form I-765. You cannot file for a renewal EAD more than 180 days before your original EAD expires\nYou may qualify for automatic extension of your existing employment authorization. See our Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension page for more information on this automatic extension.\nSome unauthorized practitioners may try to take advantage of you by claiming they can file an EAD. These same individuals may ask that you pay them to file such forms. To learn the facts about how to protect yourself and your family from scams, please visit www.uscis.gov/avoidscams .",

    "content": "Extension of Post Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) and F-1 Status for Eligible Students under the H-1B Cap-Gap Regulations\nThe “cap-gap” period starts when an F-1 student’s status and employment authorization expires and, unless terminated, ends on April 1 of the fiscal year for which the H-1B status is being requested or until the validity start date of the approved petition, whichever is earlier.\nCap-gap occurs because an employer may not file, and USCIS may not accept, a cap subject H-1B petition submitted more than 6 months in advance of the date of actual need for the beneficiary’s services or training. As a result, the earliest date that an employer can file an H-1B cap-subject petition is April 1 for the following fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. If USCIS approves the H-1B petition and the accompanying change of status request, the earliest date that the student may start the approved H-1B employment is Oct. 1, but the beneficiary’s OPT employment authorization may expire before the H-1B start date.\nCurrent regulations allow certain students with a pending or approved cap-subject H-1B petition to remain in F-1 status during the cap-gap period. This is referred to as filling the \"cap-gap,\" meaning the regulations provide a way of filling the \"gap\" between the end of F-1 status and the beginning of H-1B status that might otherwise occur were F-1 status not extended for qualifying students.\nCap-subject H-1B petitions that are properly and timely filed for an eligible F-1 student that request a change of status to H-1B within the fiscal year for which status is being requested qualify for a cap-gap extension.\nTimely filed means that the H-1B petition (indicating change of status rather than consular processing) was filed during the applicable H-1B filing period, which begins April 1 and while the student's authorized F-1 duration of status (D/S) admission was still in effect (including any period of time during the academic course of study, any authorized periods of post-completion optional practical training (OPT), and the 60-day departure preparation period commonly known as the \"grace period\"). A cap-subject H-1B petition will not be considered to be properly filed unless it is based on a valid, selected registration for the same beneficiary and the appropriate fiscal year, unless the registration requirement is suspended.\nOnce the petitioner properly and timely files a request to change status to H-1B within the fiscal year for which such status is being requested, the automatic cap-gap extension will begin. If the student’s H-1B petition is approved (or selected and approved if the registration requirement is suspended), the student’s cap-gap extension of status will continue until April 1 of the fiscal year for which such H-1B status is being requested or until the validity start date of the approved petition, whichever is earlier. The cap-gap extension of status will automatically terminate if the student’s H-1B petition is denied, withdrawn, revoked, rejected, or is not selected, or if the change of status request is denied or withdrawn even if the H-1B petition is approved for consular processing. The student will have the standard 60-day grace period from the date the extension of status terminated or their program end date, whichever is later, to depart the United States (however, the 60-day grace period does not apply to an F-1 student whose accompanying change of status request is denied or revoked due to a status violation, misrepresentation, or fraud).\nStudents are strongly encouraged to stay in close communication with their petitioning employer during the cap-gap extension period for status updates on the H-1B petition processing.\nPlease note: F-1 students who have entered the 60-day grace period are not authorized to work. If an H 1B cap-subject petition is properly filed for a student who has entered the 60-day grace period, the student will receive the automatic extension of their F-1 status, but will not be authorized to work since the student was not authorized to work at the time H-1B petition was filed.\nF-1 students who do not qualify for a cap-gap extension and whose periods of authorized stay expire before the validity start date of their approved petition are required to leave the United States. They then need to apply for an H-1B visa at a consular post abroad, if applicable, and seek to be readmitted into the United States in H-1B status for the dates reflected on the approved H-1B petition.\nAdditionally, the cap-gap provision applies only to beneficiaries of cap-subject H-1B petitions, not to beneficiaries of cap-exempt H-1B petitions .\nThe cap-gap extension of OPT is automatic for eligible students. A student does not file an application for the extension or receive a new Employment Authorization Document (EAD) to cover the additional time. The only proof of continued employment authorization currently available to an affected student is an updated Form I-20 showing an extension of OPT, issued to the student by their designated school official (DSO). This document serves as proof of continued employment authorization.\nIf a student chooses to obtain an updated Form I-20, they should provide their DSO with evidence of a timely-filed H-1B petition (indicating a request for change of status rather than for consular processing), such as a copy of the petition and a FedEx, UPS, or USPS Express/certified mail receipt. The student’s DSO will issue an updated Form I-20.\nThe student should return to their DSO with a copy of the petitioning employer’s Form I-797, Notice of Action, indicating that the petition was filed and accepted. The Form I-797 must have a valid receipt number. The student’s DSO will issue another updated Form I-20, showing an extension until April 1of the fiscal year for which such H-1B status is being requested. In such situations, the student can continue to work while the update to their Form I-20 is being processed. Because the cap-gap extension is automatic, the updated Form I-20 is not required for a student to continue working; it merely serves as proof of the extension of OPT employment authorization.\nIf an H-1B petition filed for an F-1 student with a cap-gap extension is denied, rejected, revoked, or withdrawn, the student will have the standard 60-day grace period (from the date of the notification of the denial, rejection, revocation, or withdrawal of the petition) to depart the United States.\nThe 60-day grace period does not apply to an F-1 student whose accompanying change of status request is denied due to a status violation, misrepresentation, or fraud. In such cases, the F-1 student is ineligible for cap-gap extension of status and the 60-day grace period. Similarly, the 60-day grace period and cap-gap extension of status does not apply to an F-1 student whose petition was revoked based on a finding of a status violation, fraud or misrepresentation discovered following approval. In both instances, students are required to immediately leave the United States.\nAn F-1 student may generally travel abroad and seek readmission to the United States in F-1 status during a cap-gap period if:\nThe student’s H-1B petition and request for change of status has been approved;\nThe student seeks readmission before their H-1B change of status takes effect (normally at the beginning of the fiscal year on Oct. 1); and\nThe student is otherwise admissible.\nHowever, if an F-1 student travels outside the United States while the H-1B petition and the change of status request remain pending the request for change of status will be considered abandoned.\nPlease note that even if an F-1 student meets all of the requirements listed above, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer always makes the final determination on whether to admit an applicant for admission after inspection at a port-of-entry. F-1 students may refer to the DHS Study in the States page for a list of the documents needed to confirm eligibility for F-1 status.\nF-1 students who receive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees included on the STEM Designated Degree Program List (PDF) , are employed by employers enrolled in and maintain good standing with E-Verify, and who have received an initial grant of post-completion OPT employment authorization related to such a degree, may apply for a 24-month extension of such authorization. F-1 students may obtain additional information about STEM OPT extensions in the USCIS Policy Manual , on our Optional Practical Training Extension for STEM Students (STEM OPT) page, or the STEM OPT Hub .\nStudents who are eligible for a cap-gap extension of post-completion OPT employment and F-1 status may apply for a STEM OPT extension during the cap-gap extension period.\nHowever, students may not apply for a STEM OPT extension once the cap-gap extension period is terminated (if the H-1B petition is rejected, denied, revoked, or withdrawn) and the student has entered the 60-day grace period.\nThe law allows you to be unemployed during your OPT period for a limited number of days.\nIf the student’s OPT end date is shortened to Sept. 30 even though their H-1B employment would not begin until a later date, they should contact their DSO. The DSO may request a data fix in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) by contacting the SEVIS helpdesk.\nLaid off or terminated by the H-1B employer: If the student has been approved to change their status to an H-1B nonimmigrant but is laid off/terminated by the H-1B employer before the date they officially obtain H-1B status, the student can retrieve any unused OPT if they have an unexpired EAD issued for post-completion OPT. The student will remain in F-1 status and can continue their OPT using the unexpired EAD.\nThe student also needs to make sure that USCIS receives a withdrawal request from the petitioner before the H-1B change of status goes into effect. This will prevent USCIS from changing the student’s status to H-1B. Once the petition has been revoked or withdrawn, the student must provide their DSO with a copy of the USCIS acknowledgement of withdrawal (the notice of revocation). The DSO may then contact the SEVIS Help Desk to request a data fix in SEVIS to prevent the student from being terminated in SEVIS.\nIf USCIS does not receive the withdrawal request before the date that the student is supposed to change status to an H-1B nonimmigrant, then the student will need to stop working, file Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, to request F-1 status, and wait until the change of status request is approved before resuming OPT employment.\nThe F-1 student can continue working with their approved EAD while the data fix in SEVIS is pending if:\nThe (former) H-1B employer withdrew the H-1B petition before the effective date of the H-1B change of status;\nThe student finds employment appropriate to their OPT;\nThe period of OPT is unexpired (which would indicate that the student was not actually utilizing “cap-gap” since they otherwise had valid OPT authorization); and\nThe DSO has requested a data fix in SEVIS.\nWorking while the data fix is pending: If the employer withdraws the H-1B petition before the H-1B effective date, the student may continue working while the data fix remains pending so long as: The student finds employment appropriate to their OPT; The period of OPT is unexpired (which would indicate that the student was not actually utilizing “cap-gap” since they otherwise had valid OPT authorization); and The student has not otherwise violated their F-1 status.\nThe student finds employment appropriate to their OPT;\nThe period of OPT is unexpired (which would indicate that the student was not actually utilizing “cap-gap” since they otherwise had valid OPT authorization); and\nThe student has not otherwise violated their F-1 status.\nMaintaining valid F-1 status: If the employer withdraws the H-1B petition before the date that the student officially changes to H-1B status, the student generally will remain in F-1 status while the data fix is pending. The student would have the standard 60-day grace period to depart the United States unless the H-1B petition was revoked because of fraud or violation of status.\nIf the employer withdraws the H-1B petition approval after the date that the student officially changes to H-1B status, the student’s status will have been changed from F-1 to H-1B. The student will no longer be in valid F-1 status and would need to file a Form I-539 if seeking to change back to F-1 status.",

    "content": "Filing Fees\nAlert: USCIS has implemented a new way to pay fees using electronic debit from a U.S. bank account. Effective immediately, individuals can make transactions directly to USCIS by completing and signing Form G-1650, Authorization for ACH Transactions, and filing it with their applications, petitions, or requests. USCIS will continue to accept paper check and money order payments in addition to credit and debit payments until Oct. 28, 2025.After Oct. 28, USCIS will accept only ACH debit transactions using Form G-1650 or credit card payments using Form G-1450 for forms filed by paper without an exemption. USCIS continues to accept online payments for forms filed online.\nMany immigration forms require a filing fee. If you do not submit the correct fee, we will reject your form.\nWe periodically adjust our fees. For a complete list of all USCIS fees, see our Fee Schedule .\nFor filing fees and any other applicable fees, you can use our Fee Calculator to determine the exact filing fee required.\nHow you pay your USCIS filing fees (including biometric services fees and other fees, if applicable) will depend on whether you are inside or outside of the United States.\nIf you live outside the United States or its territories\nIf you live outside the United States or its territories and you want to file your benefit request where you live, go to the Forms section of our website to determine whether you can file your form at an international office. We do not accept all forms of payment outside the United States. Check the appropriate International USCIS office webpage or contact the U.S. embassy or consulate for information on how to pay USCIS fees.\nIf you are inside the United States\nDepending on the form you are submitting, you may pay your fees:\nOnline using a credit, debit, or prepaid card, or through an ACH debit transaction; or\nBy mail by completing Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions , or Form G-1650, Authorization for ACH Transactions .\nUnder certain circumstances, you may be eligible for a paper fee payment exception that will allow you to pay with a personal or business check drawn on a U.S. bank and payable in U.S. funds. If you qualify for a paper-based payment exemption, you will need to complete Form G-1651, Exemption for Paper Fee Payment. See the USCIS Emergency Travel page and Form G-1651, Exemption for Paper Fee Payment , for more information.\nNOTE: Applicants filing for emergency advance parole on Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Record , need to call the Contact Center to make an appointment. We accept in-person payments with an appointment for Form I-131 by credit, debit or prepaid card with Form G-1450, or Authorization for Credit Card Transactions ; from a U.S. banking institution using Form G-1650, Authorization for ACH Transactions ; or, if you are eligible for an exception to the electronic payment requirement, with a business or personal check using Form G-1651, Exemption for Paper Fee Payment . Payments made at a field office cannot be split between multiple credit, debit or prepaid cards.\nFor more information on filing your specific form, go to the USCIS All Forms page. Please see our News page for the latest updates.\nWe recommend that you pay each filing fee separately for each benefit request you submit for the following reasons:\nWhen you provide a payment for a filing package that contains more than 1 application, we must reject the entire package if 1 of the applications is defective. For example, if your filing package includes 2 Forms N-400, and 1 is missing a signature, we must reject both if you only provide 1 payment. However, if you provide a separate payment for each benefit request, we can accept the complete Form N-400 and reject the Form N-400 that is missing a signature.\nWe are changing some technology and may use different systems to process different requests and their fees. As a result, we may need to reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms. For example, even if Form I-539 and Form I-129 are submitted together, we may process them in different IT systems. If both forms are paid with 1 combined payment, we may need to reject both forms.\nYou must pay for each benefit request you submit using a single payment method (credit card or ACH withdrawal) and not a combination of payment methods.\nWe may reject your package if:\nYou submit Form G-1450 and Form G-1650 in the same package;\nYou submit a Form G-1650 and you do not mark business or personal account on the form;\nYou submit a Form G-1650 and you do not mark checking or savings account on the form;\nYou do not authorize USCIS to charge or withdraw the correct payment amount; or\nYou file Form G-1650 and you do not provide the correct routing and account number.\nExamples of how to properly submit payments:\nIf you submit…\nAnd wish to pay with…\nThen you must…\nOne benefit request\nOne credit card\nPay the entire fee for that benefit request using 1 Form G-1450\nOne benefit request\nPrepaid credit card\nPay the entire fee for that benefit request using 1 Form G-1450\nOne benefit request\nOne Authorized ACH Transaction\nPay the entire fee for that benefit request using 1 Form G-1650\nOne benefit request\nOne or more paper-based payments (personal or business check, money order, bank draft or cashier’s check)\nBe eligible for exemption and complete Form G-1651, Exemption for Paper Fee Payment , and pay the fee for that benefit request using 1 or more paper-based payments that combine to equal the total payment required\nOne benefit request\nA single payment method, dividing the total payment across multiple cards or if using ACH to process your transaction, you can use multiple bank accounts.\nComplete 2 Form G-1450s, 1 for each card, and specify the amount you wish to pay with each card.\nNote: Make sure the amounts on the 2 Forms G-1450 add up to the correct total. We will reject a filing with an incorrect payment amount. Complete 1 Form G-1450 for each card and make sure that payments entered on each form combine to equal the total payment required. (For example, a $400 filing fee can be split between 2 credit cards in the amount of $200 on each. Always make sure that payments entered on each Form G-1450 combine to equal the required filing fee. The total payment amount between all Forms G-1450 for 1 benefit request must not exceed $24,999.1)\nThree benefit requests filed together\nOne credit card\nSubmit 3 Forms G-1450, 1 for each benefit request.\nThree benefit requests filed together\nACH payment\nSubmit 3 Forms G-1650, 1 for each benefit request.\nFive benefit requests\nOne credit card for 2 of the benefit requests\nACH payments for 3 of the benefit requests\nSubmit 2 separate packages-\nFirst package: 2 benefit requests and 2 Forms G-1450.\nSecond package: 3 benefit requests and 3 Forms G-1650.\n1 See the Treasury Financial Manual at https://tfx.treasury.gov/tfm/volume1/part5/chapter-7000-credit-and-debit-card-collection-transactions .\nIf you are paying with a U.S. bank account using Form G-1650, Authorization for ACH Transactions, provide a separate payment for each benefit request you submit.\nYou may pay filing fees and any other applicable fees with an ACH transaction from a U.S. bank if you are filing:\nAn application, petition, or request with a USCIS Lockbox ;\nAn application, petition, or request with a USCIS service center; or\nAn application, request, or form that is accepted at a USCIS field office .\nAcceptable ACH Transactions\nYou must use a U.S. bank for your ACH transaction. We cannot process an ACH transaction from a foreign bank. Make sure your account’s daily limit can cover the fee and that your account has sufficient funds to cover the required payment. We will reject your benefit request if, when completing the form:\nYou do not indicate whether it is a business or personal account on Form G-1650;\nYou do not indicate whether it is a checking or savings account on Form G-1650;\nYou do not provide the correct payment amount; or\nYou do not provide the correct 9-digit bank routing number and account number.\nHow to Pay with an ACH Transaction When Filing by Mail\nTo pay with an ACH Transaction, follow these 2 steps:\nComplete and sign Form G-1650, Authorization for ACH Transactions.\nPlace the form on top of your benefit request when you file it.\nWhen filing Form G-1650 with a Lockbox or Service Center, you may split the payment for 1 form across multiple accounts that add up to the correct total. Complete 1 Form G-1650 for each account. In all cases, the ACH transaction must be from a U.S. financial institution and payable in U.S. funds.\nWe cannot accept payment for 1 form that is a combination of different payment types. For example, we cannot accept payment for a Form I-765 filed with both Form G-1450 and Form G-1650 as payment, even if the total equals the correct amount of the fee for the benefit request. If we accept your filing, we will debit funds for the proper amount.\nYou will see a charge from USCIS on your bank statement.\nDeclined ACH Transactions\nIf an ACH payment is declined for any reason other than insufficient funds, we will not try to process the payment again. We will reject your benefit request for lack of payment.\nDeclined ACH Transaction- Insufficient Funds\nIf an ACH transaction is declined because of insufficient funds, we will resubmit the payment to the institution 1 time . If the institution returns the form of payment as unpayable a second time or if the payment is initially rejected for any other reason, we may reject or deny the filing. We will not resubmit payments returned for a reason other than insufficient funds.\nACH Debit Block\nSome bank account owners may have placed an account debit block to prevent unauthorized individuals from withdrawing funds using an ACH transaction. If you have a debit block on your account, you must contact your bank and give them the appropriate USCIS agency location code (ALC) to unblock our transaction or ‘whitelist’ USCIS before you file. This will ensure that we can successfully process your payment.\nThis table lists the location code for each Lockbox. Give the appropriate code to your bank to unblock/whitelist the USCIS Lockbox:\nIf you are filing your benefit request with any other USCIS office, you will need provide the following ACH location codes to your bank to unblock/whitelist before filing:\n700101031B, 700101031D, 700101031E, 7001010333, 7001010325, 7001010326, 7001010327, 7001010328, 7001010329, 7001010371, 7001010372, and 70010103X5.\nSecurity\nWe use the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Pay.gov Trusted Collections Service to process credit card and ACH payments. Trusted Collections Service is a web-based application that allows government agencies to process electronic payments. You cannot pay the fee directly to Pay.gov.\nThe Department of the Treasury ensures that Pay.gov is Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard compliant.

Benefit requestors may request an exemption if they meet 1 of the following 4 criteria:\nYou do not have access to banking services or electronic payment systems;\nElectronic disbursement would cause you undue hardship as discussed in 31 C.F.R. Part 208;\nNon-electronic transactions are necessary or desirable for national security or law enforcement reasons; or\nThere are other circumstances as determined by the secretary of the treasury and reflected in regulations or other guidance.\nIf you are filing a Form G-1651, Exemption for Paper Fee Payment , you must mail your check, bank draft, cashier’s check, certified check or money order together with your benefit request form to the correct filing location. You cannot combine a paper-based payment with any other payment methods. For example, we will not accept a money order and a G-1450 in the same package even if they total the correct fee amount. Refer to the form instructions for more information. Please see our News page for the latest updates.\nTo request an exemption, you must submit a completed Form G-1651, Exemption for Paper Fee Payment, with your payment and benefit request. If you are eligible for an exemption, you may pay fees with bank drafts, cashier’s checks, certified checks, personal or business checks, and money orders. Paper-based payments must be:\nDrawn on a U.S. financial institution;\nPayable in U.S. funds;\nMade payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; and\nDated within the previous 365 days.\nNote: If you are filing Form I-131 directly with a USCIS field office in the United States to request emergency advance parole, you can only pay with a single credit card or debit card, make a single ACH payment using Form G-1650 from 1 bank account, or if you qualify for paper-based payment exemption, make a single payment with a personal or business check . If you are paying in person for your Form I-131 at a USCIS field office, you cannot split your payment between 2 different credit cards or bank accounts for 1 benefit request, even if you use 2 different G-1450 or G-1650 forms.\nIf you are paying your fees by check, please be aware of the following:\nAuthorization for an Electronic Funds Transfer : By submitting your check, you authorize us to convert your check into an electronic fund transfer. We will use the account information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer from your checking account for the amount of the check. If the transfer cannot occur for technical reasons, you authorize us to process the copy of your original check through normal paper check procedures.\nInsufficient Funds : The electronic fund transfer from your account can occur faster than normal processing for a paper check. If your check or other financial instrument is returned as unpayable, we will resubmit the payment 1 time. If it is returned as unpayable a second time, we may reject or deny your filing.\nHow to Write Your Check\nPersonal checks must be preprinted with your name and your bank’s name. Your address and phone number must be preprinted, typed, or written in ink.\nProvide the date when you are completing the check in U.S. date format: month/day/year, for example: May 15, 2025= 05/15/2025 or 5/15/25, or write the date out in full, as shown in the illustration.\nOn the “Pay to the Order of” line, write “ U.S. Department of Homeland Security” (not “USDHS” or “DHS”).\nUse numerals to show the exact dollar amount of your payment. In the example, the amount is “$760.00.”\nSpell out the exact dollar amount of the payment and write the “cents” portion of the amount as a fraction over 100. In this example, the amount is “Seven hundred sixty and 00/100.”\nWrite a brief description of the purpose of your payment. In this example, it is “N-400 application.” Include the applicant’s name on the memo line if it is not on the check itself (for example, if you are paying the fee for your child).\nSign the check in ink using your legal name.\nIf your check is not dated within the previous 365 days, we will reject the filing.\nIf you file your form online , the system will guide you through the process of paying your fees with a credit, debit, or prepaid card. Bank account withdrawals are also available when paying online. Once you are ready to submit your form, the system will automatically direct you to the secure Department of the Treasury site, pay.gov, to pay your fees online.\nWe only use pay.gov to process fees. Always check the website address before you pay. Beware of scam websites and scammers who may pretend to be a USCIS website.\nIf you mail your form to a USCIS Lockbox facility, you may pay your fees with a debit, credit, prepaid card or with an ACH transaction. To do so, follow these steps:\nChoose ONE method of payment.\nFor a payment by credit, debit, card or prepaid cards, complete and sign Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions .\nFor a payment using an Automated Clearing House transaction from your bank account, complete and sign Form G-1650, Authorization for ACH Transactions .\nComplete a separate payment form for each benefit request you submit, using the same type of form, either G-1450 or G-1650, but not both. If your package contains both types of payment it may have to be rejected.\nPlace the form on top of your application, petition, or request.\nMail the entire package to the appropriate USCIS Lockbox.\nIf we accept your filing, we will charge your card or account for the proper amount and you will see the payment on your bank statement.\nFor general filing information, see the Form Filing Tips webpage.\nIf we approve your petition, application, or request and the payment has not been properly funded or you subsequently dispute payment of the fee, we may revoke, rescind, or cancel the approval with notice (for example, by issuing a Notice of Intent to Revoke). We will not separately bill you for the unpaid fee. If you receive a Notice of Intent to Revoke, you may respond with payment of the correct fee amount.\nWhen you send a payment, you agree to pay for a government service. Filing and biometric service fees are final and nonrefundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request. Please refer to the form you filed for additional information, or you may call the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283 (for people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability: TTY 800-767-1833).\nWe are funded largely by application and petition fees. Recognizing that some applicants cannot pay the filing fees, we established a fee waiver process for certain forms and benefit types. We will approve a fee waiver only if you clearly demonstrate that you are unable to pay the filing fees. We carefully consider the merits of each fee waiver request before making a decision. Visit the Additional Information on Filing a Fee Waiver page to learn more.",
