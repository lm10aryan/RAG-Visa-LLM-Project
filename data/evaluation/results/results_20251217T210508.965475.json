The cap is set by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and is currently set at 85,000 visas per year.\n\nThis cap is divided into two categories:\n\n1. The regular cap: 65,000 visas are allocated for bachelor's degree holders or higher.\n2. The advanced degree exemption: 20,000 visas are reserved for foreign workers who have earned a U.S. master's degree or higher from a U.S. institution.\n\nThe H-1B cap is typically filled through a random lottery system, also known as the H-1B cap lottery or the H-1B visa lottery. This means that USCIS randomly selects petitions from the pool of eligible applications to determine which ones will be approved for an H-1B visa.\n\nIt's worth noting that the H-1B cap does not apply to certain types of H-1B petitions, such as those for foreign workers who are already in the United States in H-1B status, or those who are transferring from one employer to another.",

The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows foreign workers in specialty occupations to work in the United States for up to six years. \n\nTo be eligible for a green card, the H-1B visa holder typically needs to meet certain requirements, such as:\n\n1. Having an employer sponsor their green card application (PERM labor certification).\n2. Meeting the qualifications for the green card category (e.g., EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3).\n3. Filing a green card application (Form I-485) with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\n\nThe H-1B visa is often considered a stepping stone to a green card, as it allows foreign workers to gain experience and build a career in the United States, making them more competitive for a green card application.\n\nHowever, please note that the process of obtaining a green card through an H-1B visa can be complex and time-consuming, and it's recommended to consult with an immigration attorney for personalized guidance.",

This implies that the H-1B visa holder has a long-term intention to immigrate to the United States, as they are seeking to extend their stay in the country.\n\nAdditionally, the H-1B visa classification is often used as a stepping stone for foreign workers to transition to permanent resident status through the employment-based green card process. This further supports the idea that the H-1B visa allows for dual intent.\n\nIt's worth noting that the H-1B visa classification is a nonimmigrant visa, and as such, it is subject to certain restrictions and limitations. However, the ability to have dual intent is a key characteristic of the H-1B visa classification.",

In fact, the cap-gap extension provision allows eligible F-1 students to apply for a STEM OPT extension during the cap-gap extension period, which is the period between the end of their OPT and the start of their H-1B status, if the H-1B petition is approved. \n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the cap-gap provision only applies to beneficiaries of cap-subject H-1B petitions, not to beneficiaries of cap-exempt H-1B petitions. \n\nYou can apply for an H-1B visa while on F-1 OPT, but you will need to follow the proper procedures, including:\n\n1. Your employer must file a timely and properly filed H-1B petition on your behalf.\n2. You must be eligible for a change of status to H-1B.\n3. You must not have violated your F-1 status.\n\nOnce the H-1B petition is approved, you will need to apply for a visa and/or admission from outside the United States to begin working in accordance with that petition.",

The sources provided focus on employer petitions and the requirements for petitioning employers, such as having a controlling interest in a company (Source 2).\n\nHowever, one source (Source 8) mentions \"beneficiary owners\" in the context of H-1B eligibility, but it does not provide clear information on whether beneficiary owners can self-petition for an H-1B visa.\n\nAnother source (Source 10) mentions a Supplement J, but it does not provide information on self-petitioning for an H-1B visa.\n\nGiven the lack of clear information on self-petitioning for an H-1B visa in the provided context, I would say that it is uncertain whether self-petitioning is possible. However, it is worth noting that the H-1B visa program is typically employer-based, and self-petitioning is not a common practice in the H-1B context.\n\nIf you are interested in pursuing an H-1B visa, I would recommend consulting with an immigration attorney or a qualified expert to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.",
