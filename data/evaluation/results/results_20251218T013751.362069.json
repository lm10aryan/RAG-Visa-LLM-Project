The daily transaction limit for credit cards is typically set by the card issuer, not the Department of the Treasury.

This led to a lottery system, where petitions were randomly selected for processing.\n\nThe H-1B registration process, which was introduced in 2020, allows employers to register their H-1B cap-subject petitions electronically with USCIS. This registration process is usually done in March of each year, and it allows USCIS to randomly select petitions for processing. Employers who are selected through the registration process can then file their H-1B petitions with USCIS.\n\nThe purpose of the H-1B registration process is to:\n\n1.

However, this implies that you would have initially been eligible for cap-gap extension, which typically applies to F-1 students who have a pending H-1B petition.\n\nIf you're not selected in the lottery, you would not have a pending H-1B petition, and therefore, the cap-gap extension would not apply. In this case, you would likely be eligible to stay on F-1 status, but you would need to ensure you comply with the requirements of your F-1 status, such as maintaining a valid F-1 visa, not engaging in unauthorized employment, and making timely progress towards completing your studies.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that immigration regulations can be complex, and individual circumstances may vary.

This means that if you have multiple companies with controlling interests, each company can potentially file a separate H-1B petition for you.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that having multiple H-1B petitions may have implications for your immigration status and eligibility for benefits. For example, if you have multiple petitions pending or approved, you may need to consider the implications for your employment authorization, change of status, or cap-gap extension.\n\nIn general, having multiple H-1B petitions can be complex, and it's recommended that you consult with an immigration attorney to ensure compliance with all relevant regulations and requirements.\n\nIn summary, while it's possible to have multiple H-1B petitions, it's crucial to carefully consider the implications and requirements for each petition to avoid any potential issues or complications.",

The context mentions that an employer must file an H-1B petition on behalf of the employee (Source 6, Source 8). \n\nHowever, there is a mention of beneficiary owners in Source 8, which suggests that individuals with a controlling interest in a company (Source 2) may qualify as their own petitioning employer. This implies that in certain circumstances, an individual with a controlling interest in a company may be able to sponsor their own H-1B status.\n\nBut, it is essential to note that this is not a typical self-petitioning scenario, and the context does not explicitly state that individuals can self-petition for an H-1B visa. Therefore, I would say that self-petitioning for an H-1B visa is not a straightforward or commonly accepted process, and it is uncertain whether it is possible at all.\n\nTo clarify this, I would recommend consulting the official USCIS website or seeking guidance from a qualified immigration attorney for more information on this specific topic.",

This suggests that a degree is a requirement for H-1B specialty occupations, rather than work experience.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the context does not explicitly state that work experience cannot be considered in conjunction with a degree. It's possible that a combination of work experience and education could be considered, but the primary requirement is a bachelor's degree or higher in a specific specialty.\n\nTherefore, my answer is that work experience is not equivalent to a degree for H-1B specialty occupations, but it's possible that work experience could be considered in conjunction with a degree.",

This suggests that an individual can have multiple petitions filed on their behalf by different employers.\n\nAdditionally, Source 6 mentions that under the new beneficiary-centric selection process for the FY 2025 H-1B registration period, if a worker has multiple legitimate job offers and any of these registrations are selected, then the worker may choose which employer to work for. This implies that an individual can have multiple petitions and registrations, but they can only work for one employer at a time.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that duplicate registrations for the same beneficiary and employer will render all associated registrations invalid, as stated in Source 10. This suggests that an individual can have multiple petitions, but they should not have duplicate registrations for the same employer.\n\nIn summary, it appears that an individual can have multiple H-1B petitions",

This might allow the student to stay in the United States for a short period, but it's not explicitly stated that the student can stay beyond their OPT end date.\n\nTherefore, the answer is uncertain, but it seems unlikely that the student can stay in the United States beyond their OPT end date if they are not selected in the lottery and do not qualify for a cap-gap extension.",
