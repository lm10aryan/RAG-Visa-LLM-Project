The cap is usually filled quickly, often within the first few days of the application period, due to high demand from U.S. employers.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are some exceptions to the H-1B cap, such as:\n\n- Cap-exempt petitions for institutions of higher education, non-profit organizations related to or affiliated with institutions of higher education, and government research organizations.\n- H-1B extensions, which are not subject to the cap.\n- H-1B transfers, which are also not subject to the cap.\n\nHowever, for most employers, the H-1B cap is a significant consideration when hiring foreign workers in specialty",
